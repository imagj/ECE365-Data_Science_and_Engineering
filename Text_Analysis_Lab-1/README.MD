punit2_lab1.ipynb is the lab on Syntagmatic word association minining.

This lab has been divided into two parts :

In the first part, we look at two different ways of extracting most related words in a corpus, the first one is co-occurrence count between words and the other is mutual information. For every word in the document, you will define a fixed no. of words to the left and right as its context. So, for every occurence of a given word, you will get a different context resulting in a list of contexts. You will find 2 text files containing 20 words each in the extracted folder. We will do a co-occurrence and mutual information analysis of the 40 words and see which way is better for getting meaningful co-related word pairs.

In the second part, we will use pointwise mutual information to mine most related words for a given word. This is what we call query expansion
