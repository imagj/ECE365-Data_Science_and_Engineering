    "We live in a multi-lingual world. The languages we use are like English in some ways and distinct from English in many ways. In this exercise, we will explore some aspects of languages that make them different from English by the use of quantitative indices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin comparing languages, let us begin with English. How many words are there in English? Well, that depends on who we ask. The Second Edition of the 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary contains full entries for 171,476 words in current use (and 47,156 obsolete words). Looking elsewhere, Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, together with its 1993 Addenda Section, includes some 470,000 entries. But, the number of words in the Oxford and Webster Dictionaries are not the same as the number of words in English. Why is that? First, it takes a while for dictionary publishers like Oxford University and Merriam-Webster to include new words in their dictionaries. While it may seem surprising new words are being coined at a rapid rate, a recent article in The Guardian reports that English speakers are adding new words at the rate of around 1,000 a year. Recent dictionary debutants include blog, grok, crowdfunding, hackathon, airball, e-marketing, sudoku, twerk and Brexit, many of which are words we find in use in our everyday lives. Slang and jargon could also be considered in this list. You have probably observed how some of these terms depend on where you live (e.g., 'prepone' in India means the opposite of postpone), whereas others are common in many places (e.g. the portmanteau, brunch = breakfast + lunch).\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural question that arises in this setting is, are all words equally likely, or do they occur with different frequencies? As you can expect, words occur with different frequencies, but what you would would not have expected is how skewed the word frequencies can be. That is what you will see in your first exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will count the frequency of words from a word list derived from a large collection of words -- a 'corpus' (meaning 'a body of text'). For this part of the exercise, you will use the corpus of Reuters from which you will count the number of times each word occurs.\n",
    "                                                                                                                     For this, you will need to do some tokenization. Towards that, you will lowercase all words, remove the punctuation marks and numbers. Then you will use NLTK to get the frequency distribution of the tokenized text.\n",
    "                                                                                                                     \n",
    "Based on the frequency distribution of word that you will collect, you will answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the 10 most frequent words?\n",
    "* What are the 10 least frequent words?\n",
    "* What proportion of words have a frequency of 1? These singleton words are termed 'hapax legomena' (a sophisticated Greek name) and the numebr of singletons in a corpus is a measure of the richness of the vocabulary of that collection, giving you the rate at which new words appear in that text. If you take a very large text in a language and call it representative of that language, then the rate of singletons is a measure of its richness.\n",

    "Another way of measuring the richenss of vocabulary is by looking at the type-token distribution of words in a language. Word types are unique words in a corpus, whereas the tokens are the words in a corpus with repetition. And so, a sentence such as \"I am taking this class because I love taking on challenges\" has 11 tokens, but 9 types since the words \"I\" and \"taking\" are repeated twice. Accordingly, Type-to-Token Ratio (TTR) is the ratio of types to tokens, and the higher it is, the less words are repeated, and the richer is the language.\n",

We will be considering the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 4 languages. Particularly, we will be plotting the amount of types explored per language as we explore 100 more tokens. For this exercise, complete the following function \"get_TTRs\" which takes in as an input a predefined set of languages, and returns as an output the dictionary TTR, which has a language as the key, and the value as a list showing the count of types as we explore 100 tokens, 200 tokens, 300 tokens, up until 1300 tokens of the respective corpus. Accordingly, each list in the dictionary should be made of 13 data points.
