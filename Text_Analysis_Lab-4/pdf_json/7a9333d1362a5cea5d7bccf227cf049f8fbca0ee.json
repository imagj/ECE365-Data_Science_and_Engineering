The purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in Japan by using the real-time data from 15 January to 29 February 2020. Taking into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective population, we apply the well-known SEIR compartmental model for the prediction. By using a least-square-based method with Poisson noise, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Japan is R 0 = 2.6 (95%CI, 2.4-2.8) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early-middle summer. In addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the actual infective population;",

The outbreak of the disease is ongoing worldwide and the World Health Organization named it coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020 [1] . In Japan, the first case was reported on 15 January 2020 and the number of reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases per week has increased day by day (see Table 1 ). As seen in Table 1 , the number of newly reported cases per week has increased and a serious outbreak in Japan is a realistic outcome. One of the greatest public concerns is whether the epidemic continues until summer so that it affects the Summer Olympics, which is planned to be held in Tokyo. The purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Japan, which might help us to act appropriately to reduce the epidemic risk.",

On the other hand, if T = 220, that is, the intervention is carried out for 6 months (from 1 March to 1 September), then the epidemic peak t * is delayed from 179 (12 July) to 243 (14 September) and the epidemic size is effectively reduced (see Figure 4 ).

This implies that the intervention has a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak, which would contribute to improve the medical environment utilizing the extra time period. On the other hand, we see from Figure 5b that the number of accumulated cases at t = 365, which is calculated as pR(365) \u00d7 1.26 \u00d7 10 8 , is monotonically decreasing and converges to 0.99 \u00d7 10 6 as T increases. However, it almost does not change for small T \u2264 180. This implies that the intervention over a relatively long duration is required to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.",

Of course, this kind of long range peak prediction would contain the essential uncertainty due to the possibility of some big changes in the social and natural (climate) situations. Nevertheless, our result suggests that the epidemic of COVID-19 in Japan would not end so quickly. This might be consistent with the WHO's statement on 6 March 2020 that it is a false hope that COVID-19 will disappear in the summer like the flu [15] .",
