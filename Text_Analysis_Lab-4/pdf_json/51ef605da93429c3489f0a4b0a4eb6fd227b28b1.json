This review summarizes recent literature on fomite contamination and microbial survival in the built environment, transmission between fomites and humans, and implications for human health. Recent Findings Applications of molecular sequencing techniques to analyze microbial samples have increased our understanding of the microbial diversity that exists in the built environment. This growing body of research has established that microbial communities on surfaces include substantial diversity, with considerable dynamics. While many microbial taxa likely die or lay dormant, some organisms survive, including those that are potentially beneficial, benign, or pathogenic. Surface characteristics also influence microbial survival and rates of transfer to and from humans. Recent research has combined experimental data, mechanistic modeling, and epidemiological approaches to shed light on the likely contributors to microbial exchange between fomites and humans and their contributions to adverse (and even potentially beneficial) human health outcomes. Summary In addition to concerns for fomite transmission of potential pathogens, new analytical tools have uncovered other microbial matters that can be transmitted indirectly via fomites, including entire microbial communities and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Mathematical models and epidemiological approaches can provide insight on human health implications. However, both are subject to limitations associated with study design, and there is a need to better understand appropriate input model parameters. Fomites remain an important mechanism of transmission of many microbes, along with direct contact and short-and long-range aerosols.",

            "text": "Conceptualized as early as the 1500s, fomites (or fomes) were first thought of as \"seeds of disease,\" found in the clothing of infected individuals that spread contagion long distances by indirect human contact [1] . Today, fomites are generally considered any inanimate object that, when contaminated with infectious organisms, can serve as a means of transferring disease-causing agents to a new human host. Because people in industrialized countries spend approximately 90% of their time indoors [2], the most important fomites for contimination and transmission tend to be those found in the built environment and those that humans frequently come into direct contact with, such as doorknobs, countertops, medical equipment, handrails, clothing, and mobile phones. As our understanding of microbes in the built environment has greatly expanded in the last decade, so has our understanding of fomites and their role in the transmission of infectious agents and other microbial matter to and from humans. Here, we review the recent body of literature on fomite contamination and microbial survival in the built environment, factors that affect transmission of microbes between fomites and humans, and the implications for human health. Table 1 summarizes what the authors This article is part of the Topical Collection on Biology and Pollution Antibiotic-resistant bacteria deposit and remain on a wide variety of fomite surfaces (e.g., mobile phones, keyboards, and clothing), particularly in healthcare settings. However, abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is often low, suggesting fomite transmission is possible but often unlikely. Moreover, the use of antimicrobial chemical cleaners can adversely impact microbial communities on surfaces and in surface dust by increasing the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs Increased microbial diversity and abundance of certain taxa on home surfaces early in life, which are shaped by occupancy, maintenance, and building characteristics, are associated with decreased asthma risk in epidemiology studies, suggesting microbial exposures can shape our innate immune responses to protect against allergy and asthma.",

Surveys of fungal communities in indoor environments, conducted using high-throughput molecular sequencing, have shown that they tend to be driven primarily by transport from the local outdoor environment [31] . However, similar surveys of bacterial communities in the built environment have revealed high abundances of skinassociated bacteria (e.g., Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus), particularly in buildings and on surfaces with high human occupancy and frequency of interactions [35] . Source-tracking efforts have also provided insight into the origin of the bacteria that reside on various indoor surfaces. For example, urine-and fecesassociated bacteria have been shown to be more common on toilet seats and toilet handles than on other surfaces [53] ; bacteria associated with fresh produce have been shown to be more common on kitchen countertops and inside refrigerators [54] ; and bacteria associated with leaves and soil have been shown to be more common on the interior and exterior trim of doors that open to the outside than other (more interior) home surface locations [55] . Conversely, on surfaces that frequently have high moisture levels, such as those in bathrooms and kitchens (e.g., shower curtains, sinks, and countertops), rich microbial biofilms can form community assemblages that closely resemble those found in plumbing systems and water reservoirs [56] [57] [58] . Investigating differences both within and between homes, Lax et al. (2014) demonstrated that bacterial communities on different surfaces in an individual home showed strong similarities for some surfaces (e.g., kitchen floors were similar to bedroom floors and both were similar to human feet; and kitchen light switches were similar to the front doorknob, which were also similar to occupants' hands) but not for others (e.g., kitchen countertops and human noses were distinct from doorknobs) [3\u2022\u2022]. Moreover, when a family moved homes, the bacterial community composition on surfaces in the new home rapidly converged toward the composition of bacteria from surfaces in the previous home, suggesting that the new occupants quickly deposited their own unique signatures of human-associated bacteria to the new space. While much has been revealed about bacterial and fungal communities in indoor environments in recent years, much less is known about viral communities and total viral abundance on surfaces in buildings [59] . However, much has been learned about the presence, abundance, and survival of specific viruses and other potential pathogens that cause concern for infectious disease transmission and other emerging microbial hazards.",

As an example from this body of literature, Bean et al. (1982) tracked the survival of laboratory-grown influenza A and B viruses on various surfaces, finding that both viruses survived up to 48 h on hard, non-porous surfaces, such as stainless steel and plastic and up to 12 h on porous surfaces, such as cloth, paper, and tissues [72] . Moreover, fomite transmission of influenza viruses was considered possible because influenza virus could be transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for up to 24 h after deposition (and from tissues to hands for up to 15 min after deposition). The viruses then subsequently survived on hands for an additional 5 min after transfer from the tested fomites.",

(2011) combined the two main types of approaches commonly used in the literature to evaluate the survival of influenza A and pandemic H1N1 viruses inoculated onto a wide range of surfaces common to work and home environments [73] : (i) molecular (genomic) detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which provides a quantitative measure of presence/ abundance of genetic material, and (ii) virus viability by plaque assay (for influenza A) or fluorescent focus assay (for H1N1), which provides a measure of virus survivability. The genome of both viruses was detected on most surfaces up to 24 h after inoculation with minimal decrease in gene copy number (except for unsealed wood surfaces), while virus viability decreased more rapidly to a level below detection on all surfaces at 24 h. However, viruses did survive up to 4 h on most surfaces and up to 9 h on non-porous surfaces. The authors concluded that influenza A transmission via fomites is possible, but it is unlikely if contact occurs after long periods following surface contamination, unless re-inoculation occurs during that time. Similarly, Mukherjee et al. (2012) investigated the viability of H1N1 virus on naturally contaminated hands and household surfaces of 20 individuals with laboratory-confirmed infection, finding that H1N1 has a short period of survival on naturally contaminated skin and fomites, and secretions deposited on hands by coughing or sneezing have a concentration of approximately 20-30 TCID 50 /mL [74] .",

Thomas et al. (2008) tested the survival of influenza A viruses on banknotes after intentional contamination, finding viruses could survive up to 3 days after inoculation at high concentrations [75] . Additionally, when the virus was encapsulated in respiratory mucus (which may more realistically reflect human contributes to fomite surfaces), survival was as high as 17 days. And when nasopharyngeal secretions from naturally infected children were used to inoculate banknote surfaces, influenza virus survived at least 2 days in one-third of the test cases. Similarly, Oxford et al. (2014) found that influenza A H1N1sw virus particles survived and remained infectious for up to 48 h on a wooden surface, for 24 h on stainless steel and plastic surfaces, and for 8 h on a cloth surface [76] . Perry et al. (2016) found that two influenza A (H1N1) virus strains deposited on stainless steel surfaces remained infectious over a weeklong period, with a 2-log 10 loss (99%) in infectivity over 7 days [77] . Moreover, infectivity decreased more rapidly over time at higher absolute humidity, which is consistent with other similar studies [78, 79] . Thompson et al. (2017) tested the viability and RNA abundance (via qt-RT-PCR signal) of five influenza strains seeded on three surfaces (cotton, microfiber, and stainless steel) over time, finding that viable virus was detected for up to 2 weeks on stainless steel and up to 1 week on cotton and microfiber samples [6\u2022]. Times to achieve 99% reductions in viability were~18 h for cotton,~34 h for microfiber, and~175 h for stainless steel. Specific to materials used in personal protective equipment (PPE), Sakaguchi et al. (2010) found that the infectivity of influenza A virus was maintained for~8 h on the surface of an N95 particulate respirator, a non-woven fabric surgical mask, a Tyvek gown, a coated wooden desk, and stainless steel, and for~24 h on a rubber glove [80] , suggesting that frequent replacement of PPE and clothing worn by healthcare professionals is warranted to minimize cross-infection. While there is high variability among these studies in influenza inactivation rates and survival on fomite surfaces over time (influenced by a combination of material type, environmental conditions, virus strain, inoculation methods, and viral presence/abundance/viability detection methods), there is general consistency in the literature that influenza viruses can survive for up to several days after being deposited on some surface types and in some conditions.",

All phones were colonized with bacteria, and healthcare workers had higher bacterial colonization than administrative staff. However, potential pathogens were detected on approximately one-third of phones (most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus), while only one phone was colonized with MRSA. No multi-drug resistant bacteria were detected. Smibert et al. (2018) swabbed medical staff personal mobile phones, departmental phones, and ICU keyboards and cultured for 94 multi-drug resistant organisms (MRDOs) that had been previously cultured from ICU patients, including 11 MRSA, 2 VRE, and 81 Gram-negative bacteria [9\u2022\u2022]. MRSA was isolated from only two phones, and whole-genome sequencing of mobile phone isolates demonstrated the isolates on mobile phones had different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) compared with the clinical isolates, which suggests that these fomites are unlikely to contribute to hospital-acquired MRDOs. Given the ubiquitous nature of bacteria in the built environment, studies that have characterized bacterial colonization alone tend to be less useful for yielding mechanistic or health-relevant insights than those that have targeted specific pathogens and other microbial hazards.",

Probiotic cleaners have been found to be more effective than traditional cleaning methods, with several studies demonstrating that their use decreased pathogen load on surfaces by an average of 90% more than conventional chemical cleaners (ranging from 70 to 99%; [99, 100] ). Furthermore, Caselli et al. (2019) showed that in hospitals where probiotic cleaners were used, the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes on treated surfaces was reduced by up to 99% [101] .

(2013) measured the transfer of human norovirus (NoV) between fingers and fomites, as well as between fingers and food products. They artificially contaminated human finger pads and pressed them on laminate surfaces, stainless steel surfaces, whole tomatoes, and cucumber slices. In addition, they contaminated the surfaces themselves and pressed clean human finger pads against those same surfaces [103] . Initial transfer efficiencies on the first pressing averaged~13%, decreasing over time and after drying of the contaminated finger pads. The transfer efficiency for a viable, infectious virus from surfaces to finger pads was between 2 and 4%, on average, even after 40 min of drying the contaminated surfaces. A number of other surface-scale dynamic studies have focused on the transfer efficiency between different types of organisms and different types of fomites that are common in healthcare settings, such as medical gloves. For example, Moore et al. (2013) evaluated MRSA transmission between different types of gloves worn by HCWs and fomite surfaces, finding that bacterial transfer ranged from~0 to~20% and varied depending on glove material and material hydrophobicity, while the adsorption of simulated body fluids increased bacterial transfer and also made transfer more uniform across glove types [104] . Greene et al. (2015) estimated the transfer efficiency of Acinetobacter baumannii-a drug-resistant healthcare-associated pathogen-with and without latex glove use from the finger pad to a fomite and from a fomite to the finger pad, testing six materials (i.e., glass, stainless steel, porcelain, polypropylene, polycarbonate, and rubber) [14\u2022]. Without gloves, the fomite-to-finger-pad transfer efficiency was~24% and the finger-pad-to-fomite transfer efficiency was~6%. Latex gloves reduced both of these transfer efficiencies by about half, and material type was not a major determining factor. Koenig et al.",

Thirtyfive percent (35%) of 150 environmental sites sampled in the rooms were contaminated with rhinovirus. Moreover, rhinovirus was successfully transferred from surfaces to fingertips in 60% of samples taken 1 h after scripted activities to intentionally transfer the virus from humans to surfaces, as well as in 33% of samples taken 18 h after the scripted activities. days by culture (viability detection). Only~5% of surface swabs were PCR positive for influenza, and only 0.3% yielded viable virus; however, room air near a subset of the subjects was also sampled and was found PCR positive for influenza virus in~40% of the samples, suggesting that the importance of aerosol influenza transmission is likely greater than indirect transmission via fomites. Suwantarat et al. (2017) combined microbial sampling with observations of hospitalized patients and reported that patients frequently had direct or indirect interactions with medical equipment and other fomites that are shared among patients, and that those items were often contaminated with health care-associated pathogens [108] . The surfaces that patients interacted with most frequently included medication carts, wheelchairs, food trays, and cleaning carts, resulting in between~0.2 and~1.4 interactions per hour.",

(2017) used a human respiratory activity simulator to aerosolize two model organisms-Escherichia coli K12 and bacteriophage T4-in an unoccupied apartment unit operating with four different particle filters installed in the recirculating central forced air heating, ventilation, and airconditioning (HVAC) system [16\u2022]. Size-resolved aerosol sampling and settle plate swabbing were conducted in multiple locations, and samples were analyzed by DNA extraction and qPCR. DNA from both organisms was detected under all test conditions in all air samples up to 7 m away from the bioaerosol source, with concentrations decreasing at greater distances. A greater fraction of T4 DNA was recovered from the aerosol size fractions smaller than 1 \u03bcm than E. coli K12 at all air sampling locations, suggesting that smaller virus-like organisms can transport longer distances than the larger bacterial organisms. Moreover, higher efficiency particle filters in the HVAC system reduced the amount of DNA recovered in air samples, as well as on settle plates located 3-7 m from the source. In another microbial tracer study, Sassi et al. (2018) assessed the amount of surface contamination that occurs in restrooms during toilet flushing using coliphage MS2 added to the toilet bowl [109] . The toilet bowl rim, toilet seat top, and toilet seat underside were contaminated in all tests where no disinfectant was added to the bowl water before flushing, while the addition of disinfectant to the toilet bowl prior to flushing reduced concentrations on fomites after flushing. Similarly, Booth and Frost (2019) used a vomit simulator to investigate the distribution and survival of Feline calicivirus (FCV) as a surrogate for norovirus, demonstrating that viable virus was recovered from almost all samples taken from the floor up to 3 m away from the source, while no air samples contained viable virus [110] . In a highly novel tracer experiment, Reynolds et al. (2019) evaluated microbial transmission in an outpatient clinic and the impact of an ethanol-based disinfectant by placing a viral tracer (bacteriophage MS2) on two fomites at the beginning of the day: a patient room door handle and a front desk pen [17\u2022\u2022]. Fomites and the hands of patients and staff were sampled after 2, 3.5, and 6 h. For the disinfectant intervention trials, high-touch surfaces were cleaned 4 h after seeding and sampled 2 h later. The viral tracer was detected on all surfaces and all hands sampled at all three time points, with examination room door handles and nurse station chair arms yielding the greatest concentrations. MS2 concentrations were greatest 2 h after inoculation, and virus concentrations decreased by9 4% after application of the disinfectant spray. If one can assume that microbial transfer efficiencies for MS2 are similar to those for other health-relevant organisms (which may not be the case [111] ), then tracer studies like this can provide meaningful experimental evidence for the potential for fomite transmission in the built environment.",

The underlying fate and transport models in these studies commonly use Markov chain models combined with single-zone or multi-zone mass balance models or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to simulate physical transport mechanisms, such as bioaerosol emissions, removal by ventilation, and deposition to fomite surfaces. A Markov chain is a random process that undergoes transitions from one state to another on a state space. Physical elements (e.g., room air, skin, and mucus membranes) and pathogen removal mechanisms (e.g., loss of viability, ventilation, and filtration) in the source environment-receptor pathways are represented as states in a discrete-time Markov chain model. Pathogens can be transferred and exchanged between states due to physical mechanisms.

They predicted that a reduction in close contact rates is more effective than an increase in ventilation rates at decreasing infection risk, and fabric surfaces present a much lower risk of transmission than non-fabric surfaces [121] . Similar results have been obtained for SARS and MERS in other studies as well [122] . For example, Lei et al.

            "text": "A number of recent studies have also focused on improving the accuracy of model inputs to increase the overall accuracy and relevance of mechanistic transmission models. For example, since models have shown that human behaviors (e.g., close human-to-human and human-to-fomite contact rates) are major drivers of variability in infection risk models, several studies have used videography and visual observations to characterize and quantify these inputs. Nicas and Best (2008) videotaped 10 subjects for 3 h while performing office-type work in isolation from others, recording the number of contacts to the eyes, nostrils, and lips [131] . Julian and Pickering (2015) combined videography with a microbial sampling of fomite surfaces to develop fecal indicator bacterial exposure profiles at very high time resolution (i.e., 1-s intervals) in Tanzania [132] . Zhang and Li (2018) characterized more than 3500 person-to-person contacts and 127,000 surface touches in a student office space obtained by video camera. They then used those data as model inputs to predict the intranasal dose of influenza A viruses to students and surrounding fomites and to evaluate the effectiveness of various control strategies [19\u2022]. Hertzberg et al. (2018) chronicled the behaviors and movements of individuals in the economy cabin on singleaisle aircraft during 10 transcontinental US flights to provide information on the movements of passengers and crew that may facilitate disease transmission [133] . They simulated droplet-mediated transmission, predicting that there is a low probability of direct transmission to passengers not seated in close proximity to an infectious passenger. They also collected 229 air and surface samples during flights, and although eight flights were during the flu season, all qPCR assays for 18 common respiratory viruses were negative. Smieszek et al. (2019) used wireless sensors to measure the location and close proximity contacts among individuals at a high school in the USA, which allowed for modeling droplet and aerosol transmission of influenza both in isolation and in combination [134] . Importantly, Greene et al. (2018) used a model of Acinetobacter baumannii to demonstrate how incorrect assumptions for pathogen transfer efficiency between fomites and fingers (and between fingers and fomites) can adversely impact model predicted results [20\u2022].",

(2012) demonstrated that the SRE of bacteriophage P22 applied to a number of different fomites under a variety of conditions was most influenced by sampling time, fomite surface area, wetting agent use, and relative humidity [135] . Ganime et al. (2015) evaluated swab sampling as a method to recover murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) and bacteriophage PP7 from porous, non-porous, and rubberized fomite surfaces, finding a highly variable recovery efficiency ranging from < 1 to 77% [136] . Weir et al. (2016) demonstrated the impact that variability in fomite recovery from surfaces using different sampling methods can have on QMRA model results [21\u2022]. They also reported measurements of the recovery efficiency for enterobacteria phage P22 using combinations of different sampling tools (i.e., swabs and wipes) and eluents (i.e., polysorbate 80, trypticase soy broth, and beef extract) on different nonporous fomites (i.e., aluminum, ceramic, glass, plastic, steel, and wood laminate), finding that polysorbate 80 wipes with a surface area of 10-100 cm 2 had the highest sample recovery efficiency. As models continue to be developed, refined, and applied, the importance of having accurate input parameters continues to grow, as it has become increasingly clear that they are essential in the development of realistic and useful models.",

In large observational cohort studies, conducting exposure assessments that parse out the various modes of transmission is impractical. As such, researchers often rely on so-called natural experiments, like an outbreak in transportation environments, to make inferences about exposure pathways. For example, in a norovirus outbreak on an airplane, flight crews across several subsequent shifts became ill up to 5 days after an infectious passenger vomited in the airplane, confirming research on fomite transmission of norovirus [137] . For other viruses, like influenza, where fomite transmission is less well understood, natural experiments offer less clarity. For example, in another study of an airplane disease outbreak, 54 passengers aboard an airplane that experienced a 3-h ground delay with no ventilation and one infectious person, 72% of passengers developed symptoms [138] .",

            "text": "As an example of an indirect human epidemiological study, Knox et al. (2012) investigated intra-household S. aureus transmission using a sample of multiple member households in New York City, NY [139] . Household members and standardized household environmental fomites were swabbed and cultured for S. aureus. Staphylococcus aureus colonized individuals in 62% of households and contaminated the environment in 54% of households. Environmental contamination was associated with transmission among households. Somewhat similarly, Cowling et al. (2013) applied a mathematical model to empirical data on influenza A transmission from randomized controlled trials of hand hygiene and surgical face masks in Hong Kong and Bangkok households [140] . They used inferences on the importance of close-range and long-range transmission modes, including information on the timing of secondary infections and apparent differences in the clinical presentation of secondary infections resulting from aerosol transmission. They estimated that long-range aerosol transmission via small particles (i.e., droplet nuclei) accounted for approximately half of all influenza transmission events. Lee and Wong (2015) conducted an epidemiological analysis of MERS-CoV transmission in South Korea and concluded that fomite transmission might have explained a significant proportion of the infections that occurred in the absence of direct contact with infected cases [141] . Despite some of these useful approaches, Intervention studies, while rare and difficult to conduct, provide the best opportunity to empirically isolate transmission pathways. In an early study on this subject, Dick et al. (1987) experimentally investigated the plausible routes of transmission of rhinovirus colds by infecting healthy male adults with rhinovirus type 16, waiting for the onset of symptoms, and then having the infected individuals play cards with susceptible male adults in a room for 12 h [142] . Some of the recipients were allowed to function normally, retaining the ability to touch the cards and their faces, meaning that infection could plausibly occur via a combination of aerosol, direct contact, and/or indirect fomite contact. Meanwhile, other recipients were restrained with a harness, such that they could not touch their faces, thereby eliminating the possibility of fomite transmission. Strikingly, there was no statistically significant difference in infection rates between the two groups, suggesting that aerosol transmission was the dominant mode of transmission among individuals. Moreover, another experiment reported in the same study attempted to spread rhinovirus via heavily contaminated fomites alone, and no infections occurred among the recipients. This highly novel study, with an approach that has not been repeated for other organisms or other settings to date, provided unique epidemiological evidence of the importance of aerosol transmission-and the lack of importance of fomite transmission-for rhinovirus colds in humans.",

Grimmond et al. (2018) sampled for C. diff on 50 disposable and 50 reusable sharps containers in seven hospitals, finding that 8% and 16% of containers had detectable, albeit sub-infective, levels of C. diff, suggesting that sharps containers are not likely to pose a risk of C. diff transmission [94]. Jackson et al. (2019) sampled the bacterial burden on body sites of ICU patients who were colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and the healthcare workers (HCWs) who tended to those patients [11\u2022\u2022]. HCW contamination on gloves and gowns (i.e., personal protective equipment or PPE) was associated with the VRE burden on body sites of patients with VRE, including perianal, stool, and skin swab samples, suggesting that ICU patients with a higher bacterial burden were more likely to transmit VREs to HCWs via their PPE. A number of methods for controlling antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other microbial hazards on fomite surfaces have been investigated, including UV light, disinfectant cleaners, material coatings, and others.
