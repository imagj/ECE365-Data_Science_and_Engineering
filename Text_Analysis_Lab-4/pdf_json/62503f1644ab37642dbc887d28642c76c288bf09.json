Cuts to essential services, coupled with a growing homeless population, create a challenging environment to tackle this public health crisis. In this paper, we highlight an underexplored environmental constraint faced by people living and injecting drugs on the streets. Access to water for injection is restricted in the UK, due to legislative and financial barriers. Austerity measures, such as public toilet closures, further restrict the ability of people made homeless to access clean water and protect themselves from health harms. Methods: We generated questionnaire (n = 455) and in-depth qualitative interview (n = 32) data with people who inject drugs in London for the Care and Prevent study. Participants provided detail on their life history; drug use, injecting and living environments; health conditions and care seeking practices. Findings: A high proportion of the survey sample reported lifetime history of street homelessness (78%), bacterial infections (65%) and related hospitalisation (30%). Qualitative accounts highlight unsafe, potentially dangerous, injection practices in semi-public spaces. Multiple constraints to sourcing sterile water for injection preparation were reported. Alternatives to sterile water included puddle water, toilet cistern water, whisky, cola soda and saliva. Participants who injected heroin and crack cocaine together unanimously reported adding water at two stages during injection preparation: first, adding water as a vehicle for heroin (which was then heated); second, adding cold water to the heroin mixture prior to adding the crack cocaine. This new finding of a stage addition of solvent may represent an additional risk of infection.",

Preparation of injections with non-sterile water sources could precipitate bacterial and fungal infections, particularly when used without the application of heat. It is crucial that water for injection, also skin cleaning, is made available for the unstably housed and that harm reduction messaging is tailored to speak to the everyday realities of people who prepare and inject drugs in public spaces.",

Since 2012, there has been a steady increase in hospitalisations for serious bacterial infections [1] , a doubling of opioid-related deaths [2] , and outbreaks of invasive and infectious diseases among PWID, particularly among those who are homeless [1] [2] [3] . The recent outbreak of coronavirus is of particular concern, given vulnerability to respiratory problems among PWID in the UK, many of whom also smoke (crack cocaine, heroin, tobacco) and have a much higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than the general population [4] . Drugrelated deaths in the UK are higher than any European Union (EU) country; in the year before Britians exit they accounted for one third of all reported in the EU country and, in the year prior to Britain's exit, accounted for a third of all reported in the EU [5] . In an austerity context, where health harms are exacerbated by cuts to social and health services [6] -particularly among a growing homeless population [7] -services must innovate to reach those most at risk. To do so effectively, it is essential that interventions are informed by an in-depth understanding of current constraints to safe injecting practices and how environments can be modified to facilitate or protect against health harms.",

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), such as abscesses and cellulitis, are a growing cause of hospitalisation among PWID [9] , with homeless PWID particularly susceptible to SSTI and related complications, such as septicaemia and endocarditis [10] . This increased risk among the unstably housed may be a consequence of inability to maintain safe and hygienic injection practices when injecting in public places, where injections may be hurried, with a lack of clean surfaces, poor lighting and difficulties in accessing clean water to use as a drug solvent [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The use of water from toilets, cisterns, ditches and puddles has been noted [11, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , and these sources are likely to be contaminated with particulates and microorganisms. Although few studies have specifically explored the role of water used to prepare injections in relation to SSTI among PWID, there are indications that the use of puddle and toilet water is a risk [20, 21] . Indications of difficulty accessing water among the most marginalised are of crucial concern also, given the potentially protective benefit hand washing can have against viral infections such as influenza and COVID-19.",

As a component of injection preparation, water is a concern due to its ability to carry micro-organisms, and as it might be shared when groups of people inject drugs together. In the UK, \"water for injection\" (WFI) is a sterile pharmaceutical product used to reconstitute medicinal injections. It has to meet a range of quality standards including limits on particulate contamination and bacterial endotoxins [24] . Prior to 2003, supply of WFI to PWID was prohibited in the UK under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. In response to the increased evidence of hepatitis C (HCV) risk from sharing injecting paraphernalia (i.e. injecting equipment other than needles and syringes) [25, 26] , section 9A of the Act was amended in 2003 to decriminalise the supply of WFI and other paraphernalia by practitioners, pharmacists and people engaged in the \"lawful provision of drug treatment services\" [27] . Under the Medicines Act 1968, however, all medicines for parenteral administration, including WFI, are classified as a prescription only medicine [28] . This prevented needle and syringe programmes (NSP) effectively supplying WFI, despite the 2003 law change, unless it was issued under prescription. Contraventions to the law during this time included the supply, by a social enterprise, of plastic 1.4 ml sterile water ampoules. Available from September 2003, supply was halted in June 2004 by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA), as the ampoules were deemed by the MHRA \"to have the appearance of a medicine\", and thus illegal to distribute without a medicines license [29] . A campaign ensued to change the status of WFI from prescription only medicine to enable its supply though NSP. In June 2005, this was realised; with the regulations amended so that drug treatment services (including NSP) could supply WFI to PWID [30] . The status of WFI as a prescription only medicine remains however, with a prescription required for all other uses other than supply to PWID.",

This concern was largely related to HCV risk, given evidence that HCV can survive for up to 3 weeks in bottled water and on water containers after use [25] . There was a further amendment of the Medicines Act in 2012 to allow the supply of 5 ml water ampoules by drug workers to PWID, but with no public announcement to this effect, awareness of the change among injecting equipment manufacturers and providers was minimal [31] . The only 2 ml licensed and marketed WFI available in the UK is in a glass ampoule. A \"safe snap\" ampoule snapper was made available in 2006 [23, 29] to reduce the risk of glass cuts and associated HCV transmission potential. Some NSP remained reluctant to provide glass ampoules due to concerns about ampoule cost or the percieved potential for glass cuts if opened without an ampoule snapper [23] . Distribution of 5 ml ampoules of water is limited again due to cost, and also ignorance of the change in the law, drug litter potential, and fears of HCV infection through shared ampoules. At present, in the UK, provision of WFI through NSP is limited, fragmented and inconsistent. The majority of injecting supplies are now accessed through community pharmacies, which usually dispense standard issue injecting packs, and these rarely contain WFI.",

In the UK, this is a growing population, increasingly vulnerable to health harms. Relatively little research has focused on the use of water for illicit drug preparations, apart from assessing viral transmission risk. Current harm reduction advice advocates the use of WFI, with the \"next best\" alternative boiled and cooled potable (drinkable cold tap) water, and after this, cold tap water. Our research illustrates that while these hierarchies of best practice may be actionable by people living and injecting in homes, they are not necessarily feasible for people living or injecting on the streets. We present mixed-method data generated with PWID in London to highlight the environmental constraints faced by people living and injecting drugs on the streets, with a focus here on reports of liquids used for drug preparation purposes. In doing so, we aim to inform pragmatic interventions to reduce drug, and other related, health harms among the most marginalised PWID in the UK.",

Ross' reference to \"quite shit\" is echoed by others interviewed, with a general perspective that the quality of the crack available through London street markets at the time of the study was poor. When the end-point of preparation was judged by clarity of the injection solution, this could result in the addition of excessive acidifier to break down cutting agents and manufacturing by-products in the crack [35] .

The use of alcohol in place of water was also frequently mentioned, and given that many rough sleeping participants were also heavy drinkers, this was likely to be a readily accessible liquid for injection preparation on the street: These practices were not spoken of lightly.

In the decade since the implementation of UK government fiscal austerity policies (2010-2020), it is estimated that local authorities will have faced a core funding reduction of \u00a316 billion compared to the preceding decade [40] . These cuts have impacted not only on housing and welfare provision but access to clean water on the city streets. As the homeless population has increased in the UK, most notably in London, 2 access to public amenities have decreased, with 673 public toilets closed by major councils since 2010 [42] . At the same time, drug treatment services, facing sustained budgets cuts of at least 18% [39] , have reduced costs where possible, impacting on the availability of water provision in NSP equipment packs. The impact of these structural changes on injecting environments and practice is reflected in our qualitative accounts, with participants describing injection preparation with solvents ranging from puddle water to whisky to saliva when injecting in public and semi-public spaces.",

While some harms are proven, many are theoretical and not easily measured. This is particularly the case in relation to use of alternatives to water. Alcohol for example, although an antibacterial and effective solvent for base drugs such as heroin, as an injection solvent may pose an overdose risk particularly in combination with heroin, methadone or other sedatives. Although the amount of alcohol injected is small, when used intravenously, it does not go through the liver before the brain, as it would with oral (drinking) administration; therefore, it reaches the brain faster and in a more concentrated form. Puddle water may contain a range of organisms found in the environment, including the heat resistant spores of anaerobic bacteria including Clostridium species that cause tetanus and botulism [43] and Pseudomonas species, associated with multidrug resistance and sepsis [21] , as well as particulate matter and environmental chemicals. Saliva is a polymicrobial fluid. While heating drug solutions containing saliva may inhibit bacterial growth, not all organisms are likely to die at the same temperature, the same solution acidity or in such a short duration of heating time. Other components of saliva, such as proteins, may prompt an immune response if injected. The potential for infection from saliva injections is therefore highlighted as a concern.",

On examination, 32% (n = 54) presented with abscesses and/or cellulitis. After controlling for skin-popping and years of injection drug use, participants who licked their needles were more likely to have an abscess or cellulitis than those who did not. A study of 40 hospitalised PWID in New York found that 33% (n = 13) reported licking their needles prior to injection with three also licking their skin prior to injection to clean the site and 12 afterwards [45] . The majority 68% (n = 27) had been admitted to hospital for treatment of bacterial infections although no statistically significant association was found between needle licking and bacterial infection.

Injection preparation was demonstrated for the following: heroin (n = 47), crack cocaine (n = 8) and heroin and crack together (n = 10). In contrast to Ponton and Scott's findings that crack is added to the heroin mixture after heating, our participants all describe using cold water (or water alternative) to cool down the prepared heroin solution before crack addition. This is undertaken to prevent the crack cocaine congealing in a high temperature solution but may also have implications for bacterial contamination and infection. Heating drug solutions has been indicated to inactivate HIV [50] and prevent systemic candidal infections [51] . Heroin solutions in the UK are prepared with acid to convert base heroin to a soluble salt. The excess use of acid is implicated in the causal chain to SSTI by precipitating venous sclerosis [35, 52] . Heating with acid can, however, also kill non-spore-forming bacteria, depending on the solution acidity and temperature reached.",

            "text": "It is difficult to assess bacterial risks associated with the use of cold water for injection preparation or the use of alternative water sources, given that most literature mentioning water in the injection process does so in the context of HIV and HCV transmission potential. Ciccarone and Bourgois [53] present a hypothesis that cold water heroin solutions may have fostered HIV transmission in the early phases of the epidemic in the USA. More recently, a model of HIV transmission examining heroin source-type (including cold water prepared solutions) supports this prior hypothesis [54] . Gaskin et al. [55] present one of the few studies with a HCV transmission remit to detail water source. Participants comprise 40 NSP clients based in Worcestershire, England. The majority (70%) reported using one water source only: for 72%, this was tap water, followed by 21% using boiled and cooled water. The authors highlight the discrepancy between participant-reported perceptions of safe (or ideal) practice and their actual practice. While the majority used tap water for injection preparation, only 10% considered this to be an ideally hygienic source. The authors make a strong recommendation for provision of sterile water for injection, in order to \"meet the basic needs of individuals and help facilitate behavioural change\" [55:429] . They report that, subsequent to their study, the Worcestershire Community Drug Team commenced the low-threshold provision of sterile water in ampoules. Ponton and Scott (2004) , also recruiting PWID through NSP in England, include information on water source. Of the 57 participants demonstrating heroin preparation, with or without crack cocaine, 61% (n = 35) used tap water, with other sources including bottled water (18%, n = 10), boiled water (11%, n = 6) and sterile water from ampoules (2%, n = 1). The only group documented not to heat their solution were people preparing crack on its own, with three using tap water, one using \"boiled and cooled\" water from the kettle, one using bottled water and one using water obtained from a toilet. Despite the latter finding, no reflection is included on the bacterial or other health implications of this practice. Interventions may be feasible in reducing risk. Campbell [23] reports on the pilot provision of 2 ml plastic water ampoules to PWID in Glasgow over 2 months in 2012. Prior to the pilot, only three of 74 NSP services provided WFI, and this was in glass ampoule form. The plastic ampoules were supplied separately to the injecting packs, with PWID invited to take as many as they needed. Over the 2 months, at the three pilot sites, 31, 518 ampoules were distributed, with footfall at the sites increasing by 25% during this period compared to the preceding 2 months. Sites not providing water experienced a 5% decrease.

Heimer and colleagues [56] report recent laboratory studies illustrating that HCV transmission occurs via the needles and syringes used in preparing and injecting drugs, not through shared paraphernalia. They recommend, given these results, that NSP \"may want to reconsider expanding scarce resources to provide supplies that will do little or nothing to prevent HCV transmission\" [56:471] . This view surprises in its blindness to risks other than viral transmission that could be obviated through the provision of sterile injecting paraphernalia. The reuse of stored filters for injecting, for example, is likely to pose a bacterial and fungal infection risk. Although bacterial risks from using non-sterile and alternative water sources are not well documented, our qualitative data in combination with the high prevalence of SSTI and related hospitalisation among the survey sample indicate a need for policy reform. We call for funding and increased supply of adequate quantities of WFI to people who do not have access to clean water. Greater awareness of the legality of 5 ml WFI provision for PWID is likely to facilitate distribution, given that these are marketed at a similar cost to 2 ml glass ampoules. Our study finding dissemination groups with PWID indicate that 5 ml WFI are desired, but that some sharing would take place. Despite evidence of reduced HCV transmission risk through water, provision of small volume (2 ml) plastic ampoules (licensed but not currently marketed, and therefore costly) would be ideal. Relaxation of prescription only medicine regulations that prevent drug services and other nonpharmacy suppliers splitting WFI packs (10 ampules) into smaller units would remove an additional important barrier to adequate distribution.",

We call, therefore, not only for policy reform but also for a revolution in harm reduction messaging, whereby \"best practice\" is presented as just one option among many-with others offered tailored to different levels of environmental constraint. In a context whereby PWID report use of puddle water, alcohol and saliva to prepare drugs for injection, harm reduction messaging that enjoins people to \"wash their hands\" before injecting, alongside the provision of injecting kits without water, enacts a structural violence-shaming through a denial of the constraints faced by the most marginalised. Here, disconnect between drug treatment providers, policy makers and those who they are served to care for is profound. Messaging based on a hierarchy of safety provides an alternative to the alienating potential of \"hyper sanitary\" [57] best practice. In response to the findings of the Care & Prevent study, Exchange Supplies (a social enterprise in the UK that provides harm reduction equipment and materials) has adapted its water risks poster for display in NSP (Fig. 1 ). In addition, the wider environmental constraints placed on actioning such advice need to be considered. More widespread distribution of WFI from NSP is required, alongside the wider provision of methods to clean hands and injecting sites. This is particularly crucial given the recent COVID-19 pandemic and constraints faced by the most marginalised to enacting protective practices. Installation of public water fountains, alongside the provision of handheld water purifiers and similar devices to homeless people who inject drugs, could also be considered as an environmentally sound way to provide water for skin washing and injection preparation practices.",

The kit comes in a box that doubles as a stable safe injecting space with windbreak.

The addition of antimicrobial handwipes attends to difficulties people have in accessing running water for washing hands and is of added value in relation to COVID-19 and other infection prevention for PWID-many of whom have compromised immune and respiratory systems.

(Tim) While Ross and Lee do not specify the amount of cooler used, or refer to it in those terms, their method follows a similar process: I'd put a little bit of citric in the spoon, open the stuff [heroin], put it in, add the water, cook it, put it down, add the rest of the water, put the white [crack] in, crush it up properly, put the filter in, pull it up. (Lee) I would put in two bags of heroin, so maybe like .4 [unit of street drug deal] and I'd then put in .2 of crack. No, first I would put in .4 of heroin, maybe 1 citric [sachet]for \u00a320 worth of heroin, I would cook that up, I'd then add a little bit of cold water and put \u00a310 worth of crack in there, make sure I can't see it anymore, although it's hard because it's quite shit and then I'd suck it up, usually using the 2 ml [syringe].(Ross)",
