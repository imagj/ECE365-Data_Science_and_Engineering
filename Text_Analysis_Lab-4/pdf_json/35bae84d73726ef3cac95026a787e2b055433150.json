Since then, cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, highlighting concern of a global outbreak [2] . The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases have been reported as of March 1. Of them, 183 were in the National Capital Region of Manila, of whom many were admitted to San Lazaro Hospital (SLH) in Manila, the national infectious disease referral hospital [3, 4] . We describe the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, including the first death outside China.",

It was reported that he was in contact with someone that was unwell in Wuhan, but not that he had visited the seafood market. During January 20 to 25, they travelled from Wuhan via Hong Kong to several locations in the Philippines (Fig. 2) . Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, developed cough and sore throat on January 21. Due to persistence of symptoms of patient 2, they travelled to Manila on January 25. In Manila, patient 2 was denied entry to a hotel because he was febrile and both patients were transferred to San Lazaro Hospital (SLH), the national referral hospital for infectious diseases [4] . On admission, patient 2 was classified as a COVID-19 person under investigation (PUI) based on his travel history and fever [2] and was transferred to a designated isolation area with negative pressure rooms.

Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab (NPS/ORS) specimens were collected and sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City [5] . A chest radiograph was reported as unremarkable (Fig. 3) . On January 27, the results were released of a commercially available respiratory pathogen multiplex real-time PCR for detection of pathogen genes on the NPS/OPS samples ( On January 29, further NPS/ORS specimens were collected and sent to the RITM. On January 30, the result of the initial NPS/OPS sent to VIDRL reported detection of 2019-nCoV (subsequently termed SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA by real-time PCR.

Patient 2 tested positive for COVID-19, Influenza B, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, all of which can cause respiratory infection and severe pneumonia. Unfortunately, sputum culture was not possible due to biosafety concerns. It is unclear which pathogen was the leading cause of death, but previous research has shown that outcomes of acute viral respiratory infection are worse if multiple pathogens are present [9] .

The explanation for patient 2's worsening condition and development of haemoptysis was progression of pneumonia rather than acute respiratory distress syndrome or pulmonary embolism, but it was not possible to perform a CT scan, additional laboratory tests or an autopsy to further assess this. Although he was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, it is not clear if the outcome would have been better in a high-resource setting.

In the case of patient 2, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was not made until a day before the patient died. This was because SARS-2-CoV testing was being established in the Philippines at the time that the patients were admitted, and initial samples had to be sent to Australia. Although the delay of diagnosis is unlikely to have altered management, expansion of COVID-19 diagnostics including multiplex panels for other respiratory pathogens is urgently needed for prompt diagnosis of patients for screening of hospital personnel or other contacts. Three SLH hospital staff who were caring for the patients developed symptoms and themselves became PUIs, but were later discharged following negative SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptom resolution. This highlights the risk of an outbreak in the hospital, or a 'superspreader' scenario, as was observed in other settings during the early stages of the SARS coronavirus infections in 2003 [12] . In the case of SARS, as with COVID-19, SLH managed two cases and was able to contain the infection without further spread [13] .",
