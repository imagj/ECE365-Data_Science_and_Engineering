Their endogenous levels are regulated by an extracellular mammalian N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase called PM20D1 (peptidase M20 domain containing 1). Using an activity-guided biochemical approach, we report the molecular identification of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) as a second intracellular N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase. In vitro, FAAH exhibits a more restricted substrate scope compared to PM20D1. In mice, genetic ablation or selective pharmacological inhibition of FAAH bidirectionally dysregulates intracellular, but not circulating, N-acyl amino acids. Dual blockade of both PM20D1 and FAAH reveals a dramatic and non-additive biochemical engagement of these two enzymatic pathways. These data establish FAAH as a second intracellular pathway for N-acyl amino acid metabolism and underscore enzymatic division of labor as an enabling strategy for the regulation of a structurally diverse bioactive lipid family.",

Structurally, N-acyl amino acids are closely related to the other bioactive fatty acid amides including the endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine) and the N-acyl-homoserine lactone family of bacterial quorum-sensing molecules (Devane et al., 1992; Parsek et al., 1999) . Individual members of the mammalian N-acyl amino acids have been previously implicated in appetite, nociception, vasoregulation, and bone health (Milman et al., 2006; Mostyn et al., 2019; Parmar and Ho, 2010; Smoum et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2017) . We have recently identified a new role for certain N-acyl amino acids in stimulating oxidative metabolism via mitochondrial uncoupling (Long et al., 2016) . These thermogenic N-acyl amino acids are characterized by medium-chain fatty acyl chains and neutral amino acid head groups, chemical features that are present in a subset of family members including N-acyl phenylalanines, N-acyl leucines, N-acyl glycines, and N-acyl serines (Keipert et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018) . Consequently, administration of these N-acyl amino acids to mice rendered obese by feeding a high-fat diet increases energy expenditure, reduces adiposity, and improves glucose homeostasis.",

            "text": "Because of the potent effects of N-acyl amino acids on mitochondrial respiration and energy expenditure, the enzymes of N-acyl amino acid biosynthesis and degradation represent candidate pathways for regulating organismal energy homeostasis. To date, only a single mammalian enzyme called PM20D1 (peptidase M20 domain containing 1) has been identified as a physiologic regulator of endogenous N-acyl amino acid levels (Long et al., 2016; Long et al., 2018) . PM20D1 is a classically secreted enzyme present in the circulation in both mice and humans (Schwenk et al., 2017; Uhl\u00e9n et al., 2015) . In vitro, recombinant PM20D1 functions as a bidirectional N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase, catalyzing the biosynthesis of N-acyl amino acids from free fatty acids and free amino acids, as well as the reverse hydrolysis reaction. Overexpression of PM20D1 in mice, achieved by adeno-associated viral vectors, drives the biosynthesis of circulating N-acyl amino acids in vivo. These mice consequently have increased energy expenditure and reduced adiposity on high-fat diet. Conversely, global ablation of PM20D1 leads to a complex, bidirectional dysregulation of N-acyl amino acid levels and metabolic dysfunction characterized by glucose intolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity. Polymorphisms within and near the human PM20D1 gene are linked to body mass index (Benson et al., 2019; Bycroft et al., 2018) , providing powerful genetic evidence that PM20D1 may also regulate human obesity and metabolic disorders.",

To date, the identity of these additional enzymes has remained unknown. Here we use PM20D1-KO tissues to molecularly characterize a second, PM20D1-independent N-acyl amino acid hydrolysis activity. We identify the responsible enzyme as fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and establish how PM20D1 and FAAH engage in extensive non-additive interactions in vivo to regulate the levels of N-acyl amino acids cooperatively.

This assay was selected because of the high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio that it provides, which enables robust detection of any residual activities that might be present. Two different prototypical N-acyl amino acid substrates, N-arachidonoyl-phenylalanine (C20:4-Phe) and N-arachidonoyl-glycine (C20:4-Gly), were used as substrates. Following incubation with tissue lysates, the hydrolysis of these N-acyl amino acid substrates to free fatty acid product was quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS, Figure 1a ). In wild-type mice, robust hydrolysis of C20:4-Phe was observed in eight of the ten tissues tested, with activities in the range of~0.01 nmol/min/mg (lung) to 1.0 nmol/min/mg (liver). In PM20D1-KO tissues, the hydrolysis of C20:4-Phe was completely abolished (>99% reduction in each tissue), establishing that PM20D1 is the only enzyme responsible for C20:4-Phe hydrolysis activity ( Figure 1b) . The presence of PM20D1 activity in tissue homogenates reflects potential interactions of PM20D1 with the extracellular matrix or with cell surfaces, as has previously been observed with lipoprotein lipase and other secreted enzymes (Cryer, 1981) . By contrast, using C20:4-Gly as a substrate, both brain and liver from PM20D1-KO mice maintained a robust second hydrolysis activity ( Figure 1c ). The second PM20D1-independent activity accounted for 70% and 11% of the total C20:4-Gly hydrolysis in brain and liver, respectively. In absolute terms, the residual activity in PM20D1-KO liver was higher (0.10 nmol/min/mg) than that observed in the knockout brain tissue (0.03 nmol/min/mg). These data demonstrate the presence of a second, PM20D1-independent hydrolysis activity in brain and liver for C20:4-Gly. That this residual activity is only present for C20:4-Gly but not C20:4-Phe suggested that this second enzyme might exhibit selectivity for regulating subsets of lipid species within the N-acyl amino acid family.",

We first began with a candidate approach. PM20D1 is one of five members of the mammalian M20 peptidase family, all of which exhibit peptide bond hydrolysis and condensation activity on a variety of small molecule substrates such as N-acetyl amino acids (Sass et al., 2006) , N-lactoyl amino acids (Jansen et al., 2015) , and other dipeptides (Kim et al., 2019; Teufel et al., 2003) . However, it was not known whether any of the other mammalian M20 peptidases could also hydrolyze N-fatty acyl amino acids. We therefore recombinantly expressed each of the mammalian M20 peptidases by transient transfection into HEK293T cells. Cell lysates were harvested and total C20:4-Gly hydrolysis activity was determined by LC-MS. Only PM20D1-transfected cells exhibited robust conversion of C20:4-Gly to arachidonic acid ( Figure 2a) . These data therefore exclude any other mammalian M20 peptidases as a candidate enzyme for catalyzing the residual N-acyl amino acid hydrolysis activity in PM20D1-KO tissues.",

Towards this end, livers from PM20D1-KO animals were separated by differential centrifugation at 100,000 x g. The C20:4-Gly hydrolysis activities from the membrane or soluble fraction were measured by LC-MS. Compared to the whole liver, the vast majority of the hydrolysis activity remained in the membrane fraction ( Figure 2b ). This observation suggested that the responsible enzyme contains a transmembrane domain or is otherwise tightly associated with cellular membranes. To determine which enzyme class may be contributing to this activity, we screened a variety of broad-spectrum enzyme inhibitors for their ability to block the C20:4-Gly hydrolysis activity. This panel included the divalent cation chelator EDTA (1 mM), HALT pan-protease inhibitor cocktail (1x), the pan-dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitor talabostat (10 mM), and the serine hydrolase inhibitor MAFP (methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate, 10 mM). Remarkably, pre-treatment of PM20D1-KO liver membrane lysates with MAFP completely abolished the residual C20:4-Gly hydrolysis activity, whereas the other broad-spectrum enzyme inhibitors were entirely without effect ( Figure 2c) . These data strongly suggest that the residual hydrolysis activity is due to a serine hydrolase that is sensitive to MAFP inhibition.",

From the remaining candidate serine hydrolases, we quickly focused on FAAH. FAAH is best recognized for its role in endocannabinoid signaling via hydrolysis of the cannabinoid receptor agonist anandamide (Narachidonoyl-ethanolamine) (Cravatt et al., 1996; Cravatt et al., 2001) . Nevertheless, three independent lines of evidence strongly suggest that FAAH may be responsible for the residual N-acyl amino acid hydrolysis activity. First, FAAH contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain and internal intramembrane region, consistent with the observation that the residual hydrolysis activity is localized to liver membranes rather than to the cytosolic fraction (Patricelli et al., 1998) .

As expected, FAAH was localized entirely intracellularly, consistent with its previously described localization as an ER-associated transmembrane enzyme, whereas PM20D1 protein was largely found in the conditioned media, consistent with its known annotation as a classically secreted enzyme ( Figure 3b ). Using these transfected lysates (for FAAH) and conditioned media (for PM20D1), hydrolysis activity across a diverse panel of 14 N-acyl amino acid substrates was determined by LC-MS. These 14 substrates varied by both amino acid head group and fatty acid chain. FAAH-transfected cells showed robust hydrolysis activity for four N-acyl amino acids tested: C18:1-Gly, C18:1-Ser, C20:4-Gly, and C20:4-Ser ( Figure 3c) . A strong preference was observed for C20:4-Ser over the other three N-acyl amino acid substrates (~1.5 nmol/min/mg for FAAH hydrolysis of C20:4-Ser versus 0.05-0.15 nmol/min/mg for any of the other substrates), at least under these in vitro conditions. In the N-acyl amino acid synthase direction, FAAH also catalyzed the condensation of arachidonic acid with Gly and Ser, but not Phe (Figure 3d ). By contrast, robust hydrolysis activity was observed for PM20D1 across nearly all members of this N-acyl amino acid substrate panel over mock-transfected background (Figure 3e ).

We also determined that C20:4-NAT was not a direct inhibitor for PM20D1 (Figure 3-figure supplement 1b) . Taken together, these data establish that recombinant FAAH is an N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase in vitro. Our findings also underscore the PM20D1-FAAH pair as an example of convergence in enzymatic activity despite divergence in primary sequence.",

Furthermore, considering the intracellular localization of FAAH compared with PM20D1, whether FAAH has a broad role or whether it regulates specific pools of N-acyl amino acids remains unknown. To determine the relevance of the FAAH/N-acyl amino acid pathway in vivo, we measured endogenous N-acyl amino acid levels following blockade of FAAH in mice. Because both genetic and pharmacological reagents for selective FAAH blockade were available, we performed three independent comparisons: global FAAH-KO versus FAAH-WT mice, a single administration of PF-3845 versus vehicle (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 'acute'), or a three-day administration of PF-3845 versus vehicle (10 mg/ kg intraperitoneally once per day, 'chronic').

In these experiments, we were able to detect 26 and 14 N-acyl amino acid species in liver and blood, respectively (Figure 4a and Figure 4-source data 1 and 2) . In the liver, distinct bidirectional changes in N-acyl amino acids were observed in each of the three perturbations. Those changes that were statistically significant across all three conditions of FAAH blockade were elevations in C20:4-Glu (by 2.1-fold) and decreases in C20:4-Gly (by 70%). In other cases, certain N-acyl amino acids changes were only observed in either the genetic (e.g., increased C20:4-Leu/Ile) or pharmacological (e.g., increased C18:1-Glu) model. In the blood, no N-acyl amino acids were significantly changed over controls across all three experiments (Figure 4b) . We confirmed that PM20D1 activity is not altered in FAAH-KO plasma (Figure 4-figure supplement 1) . By abundance, hepatic N-acyl amino acids levels were similar to N-acyl ethanolamine and N-acyl taurines in wild-type mice (Figure 4 -source data 1 and 2).

We therefore considered the possibility that dual inhibition of both PM20D1 and FAAH would result in a complete ablation of N-acyl amino acid synthase/ hydrolase activities, and in concomitant global elevations or global depletions of endogenous N-acyl amino acid levels. To test this hypothesis, we used global PM20D1-KO animals in combination with a FAAH inhibitor to block both PM20D1 and FAAH simultaneously. PM20D1-KO animals were chronically treated with PF-3845 (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally once per day for three days). As controls, PM20D1-KO or PM20D1-WT littermates were administered vehicle control (saline) in parallel. First, we measured liver N-acyl amino acid hydrolysis activity from each of the three groups of mice. As we described previously, livers from vehicle-treated PM20D1-KO mice exhibited a residual C20:4-Gly hydrolysis activity when compared to livers from PM20D1-WT mice. Following PF-3845 treatment in PM20D1-KO mice, the residual hepatic C20:4-Gly hydrolysis activity was entirely abolished (Figure 5a) . These data establish that PM20D1 and FAAH are the only two C20:4-Gly hydrolysis activities in liver, at least under the assay conditions used here, and further validate our previous in vitro studies (Figure 2c,d) .",

Under basal conditions, PM20D1-KO mice exhibit bidirectional dysregulation of several N-acyl amino acids compared to PM20D1-WT mice (Figure 5b and Figure 5-source data 1) . Surprisingly, complete ablation of N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase activities did not uniformly change N-acyl amino acids in a positive or negative direction. Instead, dual inhibition of PM20D1 and FAAH uncovered a remarkable cooperativity of these two enzymatic pathways in the regulation of N-acyl amino acids. In general, individual regulation by PM20D1 or FAAH were not predictive of those N-acyl amino acid species that were regulated by both enzymatic pathways together or even the directionality of change. For instance, hepatic N-acyl serines were largely unaltered by individual blockade of either FAAH or PM20D1 alone (Figure 4a and Figure 5b ). Following dual blockade of both enzymes, C18:1-Ser and C20:4-Ser were dramatically accumulated by 13-fold and 26-fold, respectively (Figure 5b) . In other cases, dual blockade resulted in changes to N-acyl amino acids in the opposite direction compared to individual blockade alone. For instance, C18:1-Gly was reduced in PM20D1-KO livers and unaltered by FAAH blockade, but nevertheless accumulated to 8-fold over controls when both enzymes were inhibited. In the blood, similar cooperative interactions could also be observed (Figure 5c ). In some cases, the directionality of the N-acyl amino acid changes was concordant in blood and liver (e.g., N-acyl glycines and N-acyl leucines), whereas in other cases (e.g., C18:1-Met), the intracellular pools accumulated with a concomitant decrease in extracellular levels. These data establish that PM20D1 and FAAH engage in non-additive crosstalk in vivo to regulate intracellular and circulating levels of N-acyl amino acids . .

What factors determine the compartmentalization of N-acyl amino acids? What are the mechanisms by which these lipids are imported into or exported out of cells? What functional differences are there between these two pools of N-acyl amino acids? One possibility is that certain N-acyl amino acid bioactivities require interactions within the cell (e.g., binding to mitochondria to stimulate respiratory uncoupling) whereas others involve extracellular interactions (e.g., engaging cell surface receptors), suggesting that certain compartmentalized pools of N-acyl amino acids might be more relevant for specific bioactivities. Identifying specific transporters for N-acyl amino acids may help to clarify the relative contribution of the intracellular versus extracellular pools of these lipids. The many examples of intraand inter-cellular transport of sterols (Phillips, 2014) , fatty acids (Pepino et al., 2014) , and phospholipids (Hankins et al., 2015) provide a fertile starting point for discovering analogous pathways for the transport and compartmentalization of N-acyl amino acids.",

Polymorphisms in the FAAH gene have also provided human genetic evidence for these disease associations (Sipe et al., 2002; Sipe et al., 2005) . These phenotypes are classically associated with anandamide elevation and activation of the cannabinoid receptors upon FAAH inhibition or genetic deletion. However, beyond the endocannabinoid system, FAAH also regulates several other classes of bioactive lipids including other N-acyl ethanolamines, N-acyl taurines, and now, N-acyl amino acids. We propose that FAAH-regulated N-acyl amino acids may also contribute to some of these observed phenotypes. Projecting forward, critical tests of the FAAH/N-acyl amino acid contribution without confounding contributions from other FAAH-regulated lipids will require the identification of selective FAAH point mutants that only catalyze the synthesis or hydrolysis of specific species of N-acyl amino acids, but not other fatty acid amide substrates.",

Instead, we observed extensive and non-additive interactions between these two enzymatic pathways in the regulation of specific subsets of N-acyl amino acids. In general, these non-additive interactions could not be predicted by in vitro substrate specificity or even individual N-acyl amino acid regulation. To the best of our knowledge, this type of cooperativity has not been previously described for any biochemical pathway. Quantitative flux analysis for the various amino acid, fatty acid, and N-acyl amino acid components will be required to understand how these metabolic fluxes are re-wired upon blockade of each enzyme individually or together.",
