Due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics, live SARS-CoV-2 has to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions, which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Based on a VSV pseudovirus production system, a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities. The key parameters for this assay were optimized, including cell types, cell numbers, virus inoculum. When tested against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as therapeutics. The limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples. The cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples, respectively. This assay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15.9% and 16.2% for the intra-and inter-assay analyses respectively. Taken together, we established a robust pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 and are glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus.",

In addition to human beings, coronavirus can also infect many kinds of mammals and birds. Some coronaviruses can cause diseases in humans, livestock and poultry. Before 2019, there are six known human coronaviruses, belonging to \u03b1-coronavirus and \u03b2-coronavirus, causing respiratory diseases of different severity, including four common coronaviruses and two highly pathogenic emerging coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In December 2019, unexplained pneumonia (later named as coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China [1] [2] [3] [4] . The initial patient was related to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. A new type of \u03b2-coronavirus was found by unbiased high-throughput sequencing of samples from patients with pneumonia. A new type of coronavirus was isolated from human respiratory epithelial cells, which belongs to the subgenus Sabevirus of the subfamily Coronavirus [4] . Different from the previously isolated MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, this virus is the seventh coronavirus that can infect humans and is named as SARS-CoV-2.",

S protein is responsible for the virus attachment and entry to the target cells, which initiate the infection process. S protein plays key roles in induction of protective humoral and cellular immunity during SARS-CoV infection. Consequently, the S protein was considered as the most attractive target for SARS-CoV vaccine and therapeutic development [8] [9] [10] [11] . In face of the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, a variety of approaches have been employed to develop prophylactic and therapeutic measures, including whole inactivated vaccine, subunit vaccine, RNA-based vaccine, viral vectored vaccines, monoclonal neutralizing antibodies, fusion inhibitors, most of which was designed to target the S protein. However, due to its high infectivity and pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 should be handled in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities, which has limited the development of anti-viral measures. The accessibility of the live virus stain is another major barrier to develop candidate vaccines and therapeutics.",

VSV G specific antibody was generated by immunized Balb/c mouse with VSV G expressing plasmid at amount of 20 \u03bcg/mouse. Ten mice were immunized three times with two weeks interval. Two weeks after the final injection, serum samples from the ten mice were collected and pooled together as the VSV G specific antibody sample.

For this VSV pseudovirus system, the backbone was provided by VSV G pseudotyped virus (G*\u0394G-VSV) that packages expression cassettes for firefly luciferase instead of VSV-G in the VSV genome. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1.S2 (30 \u03bcg for a T75 flask) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, L3000015) following the manufacturer's instruction. Twenty-four hours later, the transfected cells were infected with G*\u0394G-VSV with a multiplicity of four. Two hours after infection, cells were washed with PBS three times, and then new complete culture medium was added. Twenty-four hours post infection, SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses containing culture supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.45-\u03bcm pore size, Millipore, SLHP033RB) and stored at \u221270\u00b0C in 2-ml aliquots until use. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was determined using a single-use aliquot from the pseudovirus bank; all stocks were used only once to avoid inconsistencies that could have resulted from repeated freezing-thawing cycles. For titration of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, a 2-fold initial dilution was made in hexaplicate wells of 96-well culture plates followed by serial 3-fold dilutions (nine dilutions in total). The last column served as the cell control without the addition of pseudovirus. Then, the 96-well plates were seeded with trypsin-treated mammalian cells adjusted to a pre-defined concentration. After 24 h incubation in a 5% CO 2 environment at 37\u00b0C, the culture supernatant was aspirated gently to leave 100 \u03bcl in each well; then, 100 \u03bcl of luciferase substrate (Perkinelmer, 6066769) was added to each well. Two min after incubation at room temperature, 150 \u03bcl of lysate was transferred to white solid 96-well plates for the detection of luminescence using a microplate luminometer (PerkinElmer, Ensight). The positive well was determined as ten-fold relative luminescence unit (RLU) values higher than the cell background. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) was calculated using the Reed-Muench method, as described previously [13, 18, 19] .",

To verify the incorporation of the spike protein, the surface protein in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was detected by using Westernblot with SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera. As shown in Figure 1 (A), specific bands could be found in the lanes of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus whilst no specific band was found in the medium control and VSV pseudovirus in the corresponding position, which was generated with the same procedure as SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Monomer S protein (S1 + S2) were observed at position of about 190 kDa. The results confirmed that the 110 kDa and 80 kDa polypeptides correspond to the S1 and S2 domains, respectively.

The highest titre was observed in a range of 1.25 \u00d7 10 4 -2.50 \u00d7 10 4 /well when equal amount of pseudovirus preparations was tested (Figure 3(A) ). It is noted that the linear correlation coefficients (R 2 ) obtained at cell inoculum from 1.25 \u00d7 10 4 to 2.50 \u00d7 10 4 /well were found to be greater than 0.96, revealing an excellent linear curve fitting.

However, when the input cells numbers were more than 5.00 \u00d7 10 4 /well, the R 2 values for both titration and inhibition assay would decrease dramatically. Given these findings, we chose 5.00 \u00d7 10 4 /well for subsequent experiments.

As shown in Figure 5 (A), when assayed by PBNA, human negative serum samples showed relatively low background compared to the mouse negative samples. When the mean titre value of the negative samples +1.96 standard deviation (SD) was used to calculate the limit of detection (LOD), the LOD was 22.1 for human serum samples and 42.3 for mouse serum samples.
