Uncertainty around the average duration of the incubation period was accounted for by fitting a gamma distribution to the 95% confidence interval of 4.1 days -7 days and a mean of 5.2 days (1) . The relationship between the uncertainty in the mean and uncertainty in the 95th percentile was not reported (1) , we thus fixed the variance of the log-normal distribution. Assuming a maximum incubation period of 21 days, we generated a discrete version of this log-normal distribution, f(x) , and defined the probability distribution function as where h(s) is the log-normal distribution. This distribution was normalized such that it summed to one (as 21 days is roughly the 99th percentile). We sampled individual incubation periods from the continuous log-normal distribution and then rounded the sampled number.",

To estimate the probability of travel per day during the course of the outbreak, we fitted the expected number of symptomatic cases outside of China (Eq S5) to the reported daily incidence outside of China and the number cases exhibiting symptoms after arrival (Eq S6) to incidence outside of China based on the time of symptom onset.",

Based on arrival dates and dates of symptom onset of 30 cases, 20 exhibited symptoms after arrival (Table S5) . Thus, we weighted the log-likelihood for the number cases exhibiting symptoms after arrival (Eq S6) by ~67% and the log-likelihood for the expected number of symptomatic cases outside of China (Eq S5) by ~33%. We determined the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of travel per day and constructed a confidence interval using likelihood weighted sampling. Using this approach, we estimated that the probability of travel per day is 0.0068 (95% CI: 0.0059 -0.0079). Assuming that individuals traveled up to the point of hospitalization, our estimate is 0.0060 (95% CI: 0.0052 -0.0070).",
