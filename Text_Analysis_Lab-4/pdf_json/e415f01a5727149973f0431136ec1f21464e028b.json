Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.",

We next evaluated the effectiveness of border measures, including travel lockdown, contact tracing at the epicenter, and airport screening in containing the spread of disease. In our analysis, we accounted for early epidemiological estimates of COVID-19 outbreak from the literature, suggesting that the average incubation period of the disease is 5.2 d but can extend to more than 12 d for some individuals (10, 20) . Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated that about 64% of exported cases were in the presymptomatic incubation period upon arrival, indicating airport screening is unlikely to prevent disease importation on its own.",

With most cases arriving during the asymptomatic incubation period, our results suggest that rapid contact tracing is essential both within the epicenter and at importation sites to limit human-to-human transmission outside of mainland China. We further found that the Wuhan and subsequent Hubei travel lockdowns reduced the rate of disease exportation by 81% and averted 71% cases by February 15, 2020, compared to no border restriction. Border control measures are thus unlikely to contain the outbreak, but could likely delay further importation of SARS CoV-2 cases at the early stage of the epidemic.",

We estimated that 779 (95% CI: 632 to 967) COVID-19 cases would have been exported by February 15, 2020 if these border restrictions had not been enacted. Therefore, our results indicate that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese Government averted 71% of these cases. A previous analysis evaluated city-level risk of importation events between January and March (23) but did not consider importation timing. Our analysis, which utilizes incidence data in mainland China, suggests that the first exportation event was likely to have occurred almost 3 wk before the travel ban. Our prediction of exportation timings is consistent with the timing and locations of the first 21 COVID-19 cases reported outside of China.",

For example, our results indicate that the travel lockdowns in Hubei decreased the rate of exportation during the early stages of the outbreak by 81%. At this early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, this decrease in exportation rate from mainland China could delay the onset of outbreaks in cities yet to be affected. This obstruction of importation events will be critical to preparing an effective public health response for when a local COVID-19 outbreak arises.",

Our estimate of duration between arrival and symptom onset is consistent with data of 20 imported cases reported to have arrived during the incubation period. Due to the logistical difficulty of identifying COVID-19 cases during the incubation period, some countries are requesting individuals to self-report any exposure to the virus, self-monitor for symptoms, and voluntarily quarantine if symptoms arise (17) . Prior surveys of pandemic influenza suggest that the proportion of people self-isolating can range from 70 to 95% if those people are diagnosed with the disease (27, 28) . The risk with this approach, however, is the uncertainty about people's willingness to self-quarantine prior to symptom onset.",

Using a maximum likelihood approach, we calibrated the daily probability that an infected person would travel out of mainland China by fitting our predictions of exported cases to reported international incidence for cases that had a travel history to China (10, 34-39) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). We assumed that infected individuals can travel over the entire course of their incubation or symptomatic period. The distribution of the incubation period was informed by clinical estimates that suggest an average duration of 5.2 d (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). The longest time window over which a symptomatic case could travel was informed by an empirical distribution of the duration between symptom onset and first medical visit (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). Using empirical distributions of these two durations, we evaluated the risk of an infected case being exported from the epicenter. To estimate the country-specific risk of importation of an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2, the probability of travel for an infected person was informed by country-specific weights that we calculated from flight data. These weights were proportional to the number of airports within the country that have direct flights to/from mainland China (40) . We validated our country-specific estimates of importation risk using data from 21 countries reporting the arrival date of the first imported case (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S5 ).",
