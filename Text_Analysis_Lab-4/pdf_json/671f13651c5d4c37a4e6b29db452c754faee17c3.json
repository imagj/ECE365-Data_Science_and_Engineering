We detected other pneumonia-associated pathogens in both populations, but their presence failed to induce pneumonia in adults or lambs in the absence of Mo (Table 1) . This finding makes physiological sense: while other pathogens contribute to disease , Mo appears necessary, by disrupting mucociliary clearance, for bighorn sheep to establish lung infections (Cassirer et al., 2018; Niang et al., 1998) . Although leukotoxigenic Pasteurella was detected in the treatment population before removal and not afterward, the three individuals harboring it were not removed (Table S1 and Table S3 ).

We detected a statistically significant reduction in pneumonia-induced adult mortality in the treatment population relative to the control, but other sources of mortality in the treatment population offset this effect. For adults, our best survival model included a treatment effect and was significantly better (i.e., \u22652 \u0394WAIC) than models lacking this effect; however, the effect was not statistically significant. This finding may indicate that the treatment effect was biologically important, but a larger sample size is needed to assess statistical significance given the overall high survival rates of both the treatment and control populations. Previous studies found that adult survival generally rebounded to or above previous levels in the years following all-age die-offs (Manlove, Cassirer, Cross, Plowright, & Hudson, 2016; Plowright et al., 2013) .",

(2017) found that age and homozygosity at a specific locus were associated with persistent carriage of Mo in bighorn sheep, suggesting possible host factors that might contribute to variation in infectious period and carriage rates among populations. Coinfections, underlying disease, and high exposure frequency and/or dose may also shape host resistance to infection and increase likelihood of chronic or intermittent carriage (Fox et al., 2015) . Chronic carriers might also be individuals that adopt a strategy of tolerance (limiting the harm caused by a given parasite burden) rather than resistance (limiting parasite burden) to combat Mo.",

However, complete depopulation of wildlife is not always feasible, especially in rugged or remote terrain (Courchamp, Chapuis, & Pascal, 2003) . Furthermore, while depopulation removes the pathogen along with its host, ensuing reintroductions may fail (Griffith, Scott, Carpenter, & Reed, 1989) depends on how the disease is spread and maintained within and between populations. As infectious disease outbreaks increase globally (Jones et al., 2008) , broadening our understanding of various transmission patterns will be integral to mitigating disease outbreaks and conserving at-risk wildlife populations.

Bighorn sheep herds with clinical signs of respiratory disease often demonstrate widespread Mo exposure (median seroprevalence = 67%) but lower carriage prevalence (median = 22%; Cassirer et al., 2018). Plowright et al. (2017) found that about half of bighorn sheep testing positive for Mo consistently tested positive, implying chronic carriage. We therefore hypothesized that pneumonia could be maintained in bighorn sheep populations by a few identifiable, chronic carrier individuals (Figure 1). We tested the hypothesis in free-ranging bighorn sheep populations in the Black Hills of South Dakota, USA: the Custer State Park treatment population and the Rapid City control population (Figure 2). Our objectives were to determine whether removing chronic carrier individuals (a) reduces the prevalence of Mo, (b) reduces pneumonia-related mortality, and (c) reduces overall mortality.",

We therefore set time of exposure to the introduced strain in Spring Creek at the midpoint between those dates and coded strain type exposure as binary and time-varying (exposure to introduced strain BHS-043 = 1, exposure to resident strain BHS-058 = 0; Kamath, Manlove, Cassirer, Cross, & Besser, 2019).

We attempted to control for this complication by explicitly analyzing the impact of this introduction on survival, and our modeling efforts demonstrated the strain effect was statistically insignificant relative to the treatment effect, and did not appear in any competing model.

Individuals in the treatment population that had at least two tests and always tested positive after the first positive test were classified as chronic carriers and removed 13 March 2016. Proportions of chronic carriers are based only on individuals sampled at least two times. Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (Mo) carriage was detected through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antibody status was determined through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the presence of other pathogens was ascertained through culture and PCR. Survival estimates are presented with their respective 95% credible intervals (CI) 2008), and birth weight (Festa-Bianchet, Jorgenson, Berube, Portier, & Wishart, 1997) as factors that might affect survival to 0.5 years old.",

Population-level knowledge also can accumulate and transmit across generations(Jesmer et al., 2018), affecting a population's ability to follow green-up, avoid predation, and maintain complex migration routes. This knowledge has implications for fitness and is lost with depopulation. While identifying chronic carriers may not be feasible everywhere, selective removal preserves knowledge that may promote population persistence and growth following treatment.Our study provides experimental evidence for chronic carriage as a mechanism for pathogen (and disease) persistence, and our results may apply to chronic infections across taxa. Chronic carriers enable Leptospirosa interrogans to persist through \"inter-epidemic troughs\" in California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) populations and may play an important role in the spillover of Hendra, Nipah, Marburg, and Ebola from bats to humans and other mammals(Buhnerkempe et al., 2017;Plowright et al., 2016). Test-andremove methods aimed at carriers, such as the one presented in our experiment, are few and have met varied success. For instance, attempts to remove elk testing seropositive for Brucella abortus from herds in Wyoming failed to eliminate the pathogen (Scurlock, Edwards, Cornish, & Meadows, 2010). Similarly, culling Europeanbadgers (Meles meles) in Great Britain counterintuitively increasedMycobacterium bovis spillover to nearby cattle herds(Donnelly et al., 2003). An important distinction that may account for the success of our intervention as opposed to these examples is that we removed all chronic carriers. In humans, Staphylococcus aureus is similar to Mo in that the nares are the primary carriage site and carriers can be classified into chronic, intermittent, and noncarrier categories(Wertheim et al., 2005). Isolating patients that chronically carry S. aureus can, but does not always, prevent subsequent infection in at-risk hospital patients(Peterson & Schora, 2016;Wertheim et al., 2005). One notable difference between S. aureus and Mo is length of environmental persistence, which may explain inconsistent results of S. aureus chronic carrier isolation. Mo persists for only minutes in the environment(Citti & Blanchard, 2013), whereas S. aureus can persist for months, increasing reinfection opportunities(Neely & Maley, 2000). Environmental persistence and presence of reservoir hosts are important factors to consider when contemplating chronic carrier removal/treatment for a new disease system.In conclusion, our experiment demonstrates the importance of accounting for individual heterogeneity when determining intervention options to eradicate or reduce the prevalence of persistent infections in a population. Health interventions are often expensive and urgent, and knowledge regarding where to focus limited resources can save money and lives. Focusing resources on identifying and treating chronically carrying individuals can lead to population-level disease clearance, but the appropriateness of this focus F I G U R E 3 A comparison of mortality sources for bighorn sheep between herds after chronic carrier removal in the treatment population on 13 March 2016.
