Apart from the Antarctica, Africa is one of the least affected continents with less than 1000 cases across the continent and only 27 deaths as of March 21, 2020 [2] . This is probably a matter of time since there were until recently frequent and large travel volumes between Asia and Africa due to the good commercial relationships between the two continents and a number of countries in Africa receiving a high number of airline travelers from high-risk cities within China [4] . In fact, over the past decade, air transport between China and Africa has risen to about 630% as a result of the rapid expansion of Chinese investment in Africa [5] .",

High-income countries (HICs) that have been affected by the disease are also facing inadequacy of ICUs. For example, Italy, which has the eighth-highest nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in the world [7] , and one of the greatest health systems with approximately 3.2 hospital beds per 1000 people (compared to 2.8 in USA), has found it hard to meet the needs of the overwhelming numbers of critically ill patients, some of whom are specialized health workers [8, 9] . This shows that no one was adequately prepared for the alarming numbers of COVID-19 cases.",

There is also a high burden of infectious diseases with emerging viral illnesses such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Lassa hemorrhagic fever in addition to the \"priority infections\" HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis, and for all disease models, mortality has always been the highest in SSA compared to HICs. These infections present with fever, a screening symptom and sign for the COVID-19 making it hard to determine which patients to screen. In the West African Ebola outbreak, fever was used as a screening test, but 10% of the confirmed cases did not have fever, and a number of them are with malaria co-infection [10] .",

The application of the prevention measures such as heightened surveillance, rapid identification of cases, patient transfer to isolation, rapid diagnosis, and tracing and follow-up of contacts varies and needs to be improved at all entry points, but this comes at a cost that may not be sustainable. Modeling studies have shown that travel restrictions of up to 90% have a minimal effect on transmission if not coupled with other public health and behavioral change interventions [11] . The travel bans because of COVID-19 will also greatly affect the economy and delay achieving development goals given that most countries in SSA depend on foreign aid [12] .",

The WHO noted the lack of capacity to contain the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, making it difficult to implement infection prevention procedures [14] . We expect the same barriers from the community as noted in the recent Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), such as mistrust of response teams, beliefs that the virus was fabricated, and noncompliant intentions such as hiding from health authorities with discourse [15] . Behaviors like hand shaking, social gatherings, breach of quarantine rules, and contact with the dead may see the number of cases increase in Sub-Saharan Africa. ",
