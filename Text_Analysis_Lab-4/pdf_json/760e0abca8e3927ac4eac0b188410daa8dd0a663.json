Its objective is to inform risk communication efforts on weekly basis. This process was developed in collaboration with a medical anthropologist and experts in risk communication and public health. The information can be used to help identify appropriate responses and communication strategies to COVID-19 related topics of public interest. This paper describes the methodology and the results of the first 3 weeks of the exercise.",

This methodology uses the knowledge of different disciplines to ensure that findings and resulting recommendations are seen as relevant [4] , following best practices for public health and risk communication [5] .
