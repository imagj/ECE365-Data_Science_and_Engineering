An expanded isolation policy which pre-emptively isolated all patients with possibility of TB achieved immediate isolation of >95% of patients with TB in low TB risk settings [8] . Nevertheless, the same policy would be impractical in a high TB risk setting because there would be too many patients to be pre-emptively isolated [9, 10] . For a laboratory diagnosisbased respiratory isolation policy, an important barrier is the limited sensitivity of conventional sputum smear [11, 12] . Compared with conventional microscopy, fluorescence microscopy has a superior sensitivity for detecting TB bacilli [13] . In 2011, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends switching conventional to fluorescence microscopy [14] , under the condition that the switch should be carefully planned at country level with training, quality assurance, and monitoring on TB detection rate [14] . WHO also endorsed highly sensitive TB nucleic acid amplification test (TB-PCR) such as Xpert 1 MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) [15] . Point-of-care Xpert 1 MTB/RIF reduces all-cause 12-month mortality in patients positive for TB symptoms at the time of HIV diagnosis [16] . Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the effect of introducing these more sensitive diagnostic tools on reducing risk of nosocomial TB transmission has not been documented.",

In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)related chest radiograph screenings led to the discovery of a large nosocomial TB outbreak at a rehabilitation facility in Taipei, involving 65 cases of active TB in HCWs [18] . The index case of this outbreak was an elderly patient hospitalized for stroke rehabilitation without suspicion of TB [18] . Subsequent investigations found that the problem of delayed isolation of undiagnosed TB patients also existed in other hospitals [19, 20] . In response, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued guidance on nosocomial TB control [21] . To facilitate laboratory diagnosis-based isolation, Medical Center A started to roll out auramine-rhodamine staining with fluorescence microscopy since 2006 and completed the switch by early 2010s. We aimed to assess whether switching from conventional microscopy to a more sensitive rapid diagnostic tool improves early detection and prompt isolation of hospitalized patients with undiagnosed TB.",

Contact investigation had been expanded to all HCWs who were exposed to TB patients since 2004. Sputum smear auramine-rhodamine staining with fluorescent microscopy started in 2006.

There were several probable reasons. First, the low adoption rate (due to cost issues) may not be enough to make an impact on shortening the overall infectious duration. Second, because of the lower sensitivity of TB-PCR in smear-negative respiratory specimens, TB-PCR was performed predominantly in specimens with positive AFS to distinguish M. tuberculosis from non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The negative result does not exclude the possibility that universal use of automatic TB-PCR, such as Xpert 1 MTB/RIF, may further shorten the time to respiratory isolation.",

To distinguish these two different situations, we defined hospitalization due to comorbidities as the reason of admission being for the management of acute complications from non-infectious diseases, while lack of typical presentation was defined as the absence of prolonged cough for more than 3 weeks, clinical suspicion of pulmonary TB based on chest radiography, or already having a confirmed diagnosis. Multivariable regression established that hospitalization due to comorbidities was a risk factor independent from lack of typical presentations ( Table 2) .",

The HCWs in specialties units often concentrate on the management of acute complications of non-infectious chronic diseases and are not trained or prepared for diagnosing concomitant TB in their patients. The 2003 large nosocomial TB outbreak in Taipei [18] involving more than 65 HCWs, occurred exactly under such scenario -an elderly patient with acute stroke was hospitalized to a rehabilitation unit, without being suspected to also have active TB. The harm is two-way. First, the patients are at increased risk for morbidities and mortality from delayed diagnosis and treatment of TB. Second, the HCWs are at increased risk of nosocomial TB outbreak, which could be fatal if the strain is multidrugresistant or extensively drug-resistant [25] .",

Moreover, certain risk factor, such as smoking, increases the risk of both TB and chronic diseases [29] .

Second, the study hospital closely followed the national guidance on nosocomial TB control policies issued by Taiwan CDC. Therefore, our findings might not be generalizable to hospitals with less proficiency. Third, the study hospital is a medical center, and therefore might not represent situations in smaller hospitals. Nevertheless, under NHI in Taiwan, people can and did directly seek health care in medical centers, without the need of referral from general practitioners. The 3 million annual outpatient visits and more than 90 thousand hospitalizations per year in the study hospital were predominantly from primary care services, rather than tertiary referral care. Finally, since Taiwan has a low HIV prevalence [35] , only two of TB patients had HIV coinfection in our study. Thus, our conclusions might not be generalized to countries with a high HIV prevalence.",
