            "text": "RNA virus | virus replication | proofreading | ribavirin | fold evolution F aithful transmission of genetic information is central to all living organisms. In the RNA virus world, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) lack co-and postreplicative fidelityenhancing pathways, and final RNA genome copies incorporate mutations at a much higher rate than that observed for DNA genomes (1) . The low fidelity accompanying viral RNA genome synthesis is mostly responsible for viral RNA genome diversity. The best-adapted genomes are subsequently selected in the host cell; thus, diversity is essential for both viral fitness and pathogenesis (2, 3) . The difference in replication fidelity between DNA-and RNA-based genomes has been correlated to the difference in their genome size. RNA virus genomes range from \u223c3-32 kb in size; DNA-based organisms with genome sizes up to several hundred megabases necessitate a replication machinery that is much more accurate than that of their viral counterparts (3) . The low fidelity of RdRps has been exploited as an Achilles heel to combat viral infections since a promiscuous substrate choice renders the RdRps prone to incorporate nucleotide analogs into viral RNA. This family of molecules constitutes one of the cornerstones of antiviral strategies. Many RNA viruses are sensitive to ribavirin (Rbv), a mutagenic guanosine analog discovered more than 40 y ago (4) . Rbv exerts its antiviral activity through numerous and possibly nonmutually exclusive mechanisms, which are not fully understood (5) . Among those mechanisms, Rbv 5\u2032-triphosphate (Rbv-TP) serves as a substrate for the viral RdRp and is incorporated into the nascent viral genome. The ambiguous coding nature of its purine-mimicking nucleobase accounts for its antiviral effect through lethal mutagenesis (6) . Additionally, Rbv 5\u2032-monophosphate is a potent inhibitor of the cellular enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). IMPDH inhibition depresses cytoplasmic GTP pools, thus affecting RNA polymerase fidelity through nucleotide pool imbalance. Importantly, in contrast to hepatitis C virus (7) , respiratory syncytial virus (8) , and Lassa fever (9) infections, coronavirus (CoV)-infected patients do not respond to Rbv (10, 11) .",

The CoV replication/transcription complex harbors a wide variety of RNA processing activities, with some being typically found in RNA viruses, such as RdRp (nsp12) and helicase (nsp13) (15) . Nsp12-RdRp requires a processivity factor made of the CoV nsp7/nsp8 complex (16) . Other activities are generally found in RNA viruses with a cytoplasmic life cycle, such as methyltransferase (MTase) activities involved in RNA cap modification. An N7-MTase activity resides in the carboxyl (C) terminus domain of nsp14 (17) and a 2\u2032O-MTase activity was identified in nsp16 (18) . Interestingly, additional processing activities are found and are less common in RNA viruses, such as an endoribonuclease (nsp15) (19, 20) that is involved in innate immune response evasion (21) and a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) in the amino (N) terminus of nsp14 (22) .",

These viruses are able to faithfully synthesize their large genomic RNA. We report, however, that their main RNA polymerase, nsp12, is not accurate. To achieve accuracy, CoVs have acquired nsp14, a bifunctional enzyme able to methylate the viral RNA cap [methyltransferase (MTase)] and excise erroneous mutagenic nucleotides inserted by nsp12. Strikingly, ribavirin can be excised from the viral genome, thus showing no antiviral activity. The crystal structure of nsp14 shows that it is unique, having been replaced by other MTase types during evolution. This unprecedented RNA correction machinery has allowed RNA genome size expansion, but also provided potential nucleoside drug resistance to these deadly pathogens.",

For example, the Lassa virus carries 3\u2032-5\u2032 ExoN activity involved in immune suppression (24) . Among nidoviruses, 3\u2032-5\u2032 ExoN activity is found in all large-genome nidoviruses (in addition to CoVs, toroviruses, and roniviruses, with 28-kb and 26-kb genomes, respectively), as well as in mesoniviruses (\u223c20 kb). Shortgenome nidoviruses (arteriviruses, \u223c13-15 kb) lack such ExoN activity (25) . Acquisition of such ExoN activity might have allowed nidoviruses to evolve larger genomes (26) . Moreover, since nsp14-ExoN belongs to the DEDD 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease superfamily (22) , which includes DNA proofreading enzymes, this activity was proposed to be involved in a CoV RNA proofreading mechanism (15) . Indeed, genetic inactivation of nsp14-ExoN of the CoV murine hepatitis virus and the SARS-CoV results in 15fold and 21-fold more mutations in genomes than for wild-type (wt) viruses in infected cells, respectively (27, 28) . Consistent with these results, a wt nsp14-ExoN proofreading activity protects SARS-CoV from the deleterious effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (29) . Hence, inactivation of the ExoN activity sensitizes the virus to 5-FU, leading to a 14-fold increase in genomic mutations relative to wt (29) .",

Rbv 5\u2032-monophosphate is incorporated at the 3\u2032-end of RNA by the SARS-CoV polymerase. It is also efficiently excised by the nsp14-ExoN activity, which acts as a proofreading activity.

            "text": "Structure of the nsp14-Exonuclease Domain. The ExoN domain is an \u03b1/\u03b2 fold constituted of six \u03b1-helices and 10 strands, organized into three distinct \u03b2-sheets ( Fig. 2A) . The core of the domain is formed by a central \u03b2-sheet made up of five antiparallel strands (\u03b210, \u03b27, \u03b22, \u03b23, and \u03b24) and surrounded by five helices (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, \u03b14, and \u03b16). Despite a pronounced twist of the central sheet, the fold is reminiscent of that of the DEDD exonuclease superfamily (36) (Fig. 2B) . A Protein Data Bank fold search on the SARS-CoV ExoN domain retrieves the structures of the human 3\u2032-5\u2032 ExoN (37) and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ribonuclease T (38), both with an rmsd of 1.2 \u00c5. From this central domain, between the \u03b24 and \u03b12 spike, a \u03b2-hairpin structure containing \u03b25 and \u03b26 (residues 122-138) forms with \u03b21 a second antiparallel \u03b2-sheet-binding nsp10. The third antiparallel \u03b2-sheet grows out of the base of the central core domain between \u03b14 and \u03b210. It is made up of \u03b29 and \u03b28, and presents at its base a first zinc finger motif comprising residues Cys207, Cys210, Cys226, and His229. A second zinc finger located between \u03b15 and \u03b16 is formed by residues His257, Cys261, His264, and Cys279.",

Here, the N terminus of nsp10 is stabilized by the first 25 residues of nsp14, forming a clamp that accommodates the first 10 residues of nsp10. The interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is figuratively similar to a hand (nsp14) over fist (nsp10). Fingers are formed by the whole flexible N terminus region of nsp14 (residues 1-50), \u03b21 (residues 51-55), and an antiparallel \u03b2-strand budding out from the ExoN domain (residues 122-138), while the palm is constituted by top and side (residues 55-69 and 195-202) of the ExoN domain ( Fig. 1) . Consequently, in this analogy, the cavity holding the active site of the exonuclease domain is located on the back of the palm and the interaction surface of nsp10 with nsp14 is substantially wider than that observed for nsp10/nsp16 (34, 35) . Indeed, the nsp10/ nsp14 interaction surface is of 7,798 \u00c5 2 versus 3,225 \u00c5 2 for nsp10/nsp16. This particular mode of interaction of nsp10 with nsp14 suggests how nsp14-ExoN activity is stimulated by nsp10 (30) . In the presence of nsp10, residues of the ExoN active site are correctly positioned and form a highly active ExoN, as judged by the observed distance between catalytic residues. In the absence of nsp10, using SAXS (SI Text and Fig. S2 ), we observed large conformational changes in the N terminus of nsp14, which impact the overall shape of the exonuclease fold (Fig. S3 ). Without the fist (nsp10), the fingers of the hand fold onto the palm; by doing so, they distort the cavity containing the ExoN catalytic residues. This cavity is located in the back of the palm, by moving up the \u03b1-helix (residues 147-159) forming the top of the RNAbinding path, with distant residues (residues 110-117) repositioning the \u03b2-sheet. This distortion indicates that the ExoN catalytic pocket partially collapses in the absence of nsp10, accounting for the weak ExoN activity of nsp14 alone (30) .",

Sequence analyses show that amino acids forming the flexible hinge are conserved across Coronavirinae, suggesting that they play a critical and functional role in regulation of the nsp14 hinge region movement. Indeed, this particular structure allows lateral and rotational movements of the C-terminal domain with respect to the N-terminal domain, such that an \u223c13 \u00c5 deviation is observed from one peptide chain to the other (crystallography and SAXS analysis in Fig. S3 ).",

The fold presents a central five-stranded \u03b2-sheet made up of four parallel strands (\u03b212, \u03b211, \u03b214, and \u03b215) and one antiparallel strand (\u03b222). The central \u03b2-sheet is sandwiched between a single \u03b1-helix (\u03b17) and three long loops punctuated by two small helices (\u03b18 and \u03b73). The central sheet is surrounded by two strands (\u03b213 and \u03b219), which are perpendicular but not fully aligned with the central sheet. Between \u03b215 and the second turn, \u03b73 is inserted into the \u03b2-sheet of the hinge (discussed above), which forms a lid above the active site. Following the turn is a long flexible extension drifting almost away from the \u03b2-sheet, which ends with a \u03b2-strand (\u03b220) involved in a parallel \u03b2-sheet with another strand (\u03b221). A long, disordered region (residues 453-465) not built in our structural model separates the two strands, and we postulate that it may serve as a binding platform for other partners (39) . The strand is followed by a long helix (\u03b19). Between the tip of strand \u03b221 and the bottom of helix \u03b19, a third zinc-binding site is found. It is formed by residues Cys452, Cys477, Cys484, and His487. This zinc finger constrains the structure locally and orients \u03b19 toward the center of the structure, making \u03b19 and \u03b17 cross each other and positioning the C terminus of the helix just above the \u03b2-sheet, allowing strand \u03b222 to complete the central \u03b2-sheet. The C terminus of nsp14 ends with a helix (\u03b110) which is at almost 90\u00b0f rom strand \u03b222 and, together with \u03b19, sandwiches the parallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b220-\u03b221).

Briefly, the Rossmann fold can be described as a seven-stranded \u03b2-sheet with at least three parallel \u03b1-helices on each side (\u03b1/\u03b2 fold). Some variations of the fold have been observed among structures of dinucleotidebinding domains: Variations include the number of \u03b2-strands in the complete \u03b2-sheet that forms the Rossmann fold, as well as the length and number of secondary structures of the segment that connects the second and third \u03b2-strands (43) . Two landmarks of the Rossmann fold family are the first structural feature, \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2, and the motif sequence G-x-G-(x) n -G, which both constitute the NTP-binding site.

Based on both the amino acids exposed to the surface of the saddle and sequence conservation across Coronavirinae, 14 mutants in the nsp14 N7-MTase domain were generated (Y296A, P297A, N306A, R310A, V466K, L468K, K469A, C473A, T475A, L479A, H487A, L495A, Y498A, and N499A). As a control, the nsp14-ExoN catalytic site mutant (D90A/E92A) was also included in the study. The propensity of these nsp14 mutants to interact with nsp12-RdRp and their respective ExoN and N7-MTase activities were determined as previously described (18, 30, 44) . As shown in Table S2 , three nsp14 substitutions (R310A, H487A, and L495A) significantly alter N7-MTase activity (1% \u00b1 0.1, 14% \u00b1 2.5, and 26% \u00b1 0.7, respectively). The critical role of the R310 residue in cap methylation has already been demonstrated as an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding residue (40) . Interestingly, seven residues in the nsp14 N7-MTase domain (Y296, P297, C473, T475, H487, L495, and Y498) are essential for ExoN activity (Fig. S5 ). These mutants are correctly folded since they retain either interaction with nsp12-RdRp (Fig. S6 ) or N7-MTase activity (Table S2 ) (except nsp14 H487A, which is altered for all three properties tested, as discussed below). Finally, two nsp14 residues (H487 and Y498) are critical for the interaction with nsp12-RdRp in vitro (Fig. S6 ). His487 is located in zinc finger 3 of the N7-MTase domain (Fig. S5 ). Whereas the nsp14 Y498A mutant conserves an N7-MTase activity in the same range as nsp14 wt (95% \u00b1 6), the nsp14 H487A mutant exhibits a substantially reduced N7-MTase activity (14% \u00b1 2.5). The nsp14 H487 residue may be involved in charge-mediated protein/protein interactions since the nsp14 H487R mutant fully conserved N7-MTase activity (31) , consistent with the nsp14/nsp12 interaction site proposed here.",

We compared the SARS-CoV polymerase complex (formed of nsp12/nsp8/nsp7) and Dengue virus (DENV) NS5 for their efficiency of single \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" nucleotide incorporation into RNA (Fig. 4) . Both polymerases incorporate GMP (corresponding to the \"correct\" Watson-Crick base pair) efficiently into this RNA. The two polymerases, however, exhibit strikingly different fidelity. DENV NS5 does not significantly misincorporate nucleotides, even with up to 8 mM UTP, ATP, or CTP (Fig. 4C ). This observation is in line with DENV RdRp fidelity, estimated between 1/34,000 (i.e., error rate of 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for the U:C mispair) and 1/135,000 (i.e., error rate of 7.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for the C:C mispair) (46) . In contrast, G:A, U:U, and A:C mismatches are readily detected in the presence of the SARS-CoV polymerase complex (Fig. 4B) . Using a variety of RNA templates, single-nucleotide primer extension opposite AMP, UMP, and GMP was similarly monitored (Fig. S7) .

Is the nsp12-RdRp permissive to nucleotide analog incorporation into RNA? If yes, could the analog be excised by the associated ExoN activity? We first examined if Rbv-TP could serve as a nucleotide substrate of the SARS-CoV polymerase complex (Fig. 6A) . Rbv 5\u2032-monophosphate (Rbv) is incorporated into RNA, preferentially opposite template pyrimidines (UMP or CMP) (Fig. 6A) , around 100-fold less efficiently than a regular Watson-Crick base pair (Fig. 6B) . To determine if ExoN activity could excise Rbv from the 3\u2032-end of a primer, we used a synthetic RNA primer exhibiting an Rbv monophosphate at its 3\u2032 end (named LS2-Rbv) annealed to the RNA template LS15, resulting in Rbv opposite CMP (Table S3 ). This RNA substrate was first tested with a high concentration of nsp14 alone: A rapid disappearance of the Rbv-terminated primer is observed over time (Fig. 6C) , confirming that an intact ribose, rather than the base, is a strong determinant of nsp14 substrate selectivity (30) . The addition of increasing concentrations of nsp10 stimulates the excision rate of the terminal Rbv (Fig. 6C) . The rate of nsp10/nsp14-mediated Rbv excision is about fourfold faster than that of an A:A mismatch (Fig.  6D) , which are data that can be extended to any erroneous nucleotide incorporation. Indeed, it was shown that single mismatches of any type are removed by the SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14-ExoN activity with a similar efficacy (30) .",

We demonstrate here, at the molecular level, that CoVs have indeed acquired an enzyme able to enhance the overall fidelity, and that this event might have directly promoted the jump in size of CoV genomes.

However, based on our analysis, SARS-CoV nsp14 does not present the signature of a Rossmann fold: It lacks the defining motif \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 (Fig. 3) and presents the structural constraint of a zinc-binding site stacking a long helix (\u03b19) structuring the \u03b2-sheet. Moreover, a sequence analysis of SARS-CoV N7-MTase with a distant homology search only retrieves CoV sequences. Altogether, these findings indicate that the nsp14 N7-MTase domain has appeared during evolution independent from Rossmann fold MTases. It would seem logical that the nsp14 N7-MTases had appeared before Rossmann fold MTases, because the latter had successfully evolved to N7-methylate mRNA caps of all species that use the RNA cap to initiate their mRNA translations.",

When binding to the amino terminus of nsp14, nsp10 allows the exonuclease active site to adopt a stably closed conformation, allowing efficient hydrolysis of dsRNA. Conversely, in the absence of nsp10, large conformational changes in the N terminus of nsp14 occur, as shown by SAXS, leading to a weak ExoN activity (30) .

These large movements may allow different functions and interactions with protein partners. The latter property is reminiscent of intrinsically disordered proteins, which have evolved binding platforms to perform sequential activities. Fur-thermore, the hinge may act as a molecular switch. Indeed, nsp14 is directly involved in at least two processes that use two different kinds of RNA substrates. During replication, newly synthesized dsRNA with a mismatch should be translocated from the RNA polymerase to the ExoN catalytic cavity of nsp14. During transcription, a nascent 5\u2032-cap mRNA should go into the N7-MTase catalytic tunnel of nsp14 (Fig. 7) . It was shown previously that the ExoN domain is closely involved in the activity of the N7-MTase (40) . In the present study, we establish the reciprocity with the nsp14 N7-MTase domain that is essential for the ExoN activity. These results could be explained by alteration of the nsp14 flexibility. In fact, two conserved residues (Y296 and P297) located in the hinge of nsp14 and involved in the flexibility are essential for the ExoN activity. Altogether, these structural data combining structure and flexibility strengthen the unique feature of CoV nsp14.",

From this observation, we hypothesize that (i) the acquisition of nsp14-ExoN as an active part of the replication complex to increase fidelity has allowed relaxation of nucleotide selection by the viral RdRp, and (ii) as a consequence of this compensated low fidelity, larger RNA \"coronavirus-like\" genomes but encoding for a RdRp with much better intrinsic fidelity may exist; together with an associated ExoN, there might be further evolutionary space to satisfy Drake's rule of approximately one mutation per replicated \"larger\" genome. Clearly, the origin and fate of nidovirus nsp14 sequences, structures, and activities may be significantly informative in the history of RNA-to-DNA genome evolutions. In summary, we have reconstituted a functional pathway demonstrating that misincorporated nucleotides can be excised from the nascent viral genome. The conservation of nsp10, nsp12, and nsp14 across the CoV genus suggests that our finding may well apply to many members of the Coronaviridae family. Hence, a direct consequence of the CoV RNA proofreading system is its potential impact on antiviral strategies using nucleoside analogs, as illustrated by the excision of Rbv. Interestingly, the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN activity is inactive on dsRNA substrates bearing 3\u2032-end ribose modifications (30) . These results make the design of nonexcisable chain terminators a rational strategy for anti-CoV. Accordingly, Gilead's GS-5734 1\u2032-cyano-substituted nucleoside ribose analog was reported active against, at least, the MERS-CoV with an EC 50 value of 0.34 \u03bcM (50). Very recently, the GS-5734 spectrum of action was extended to SARS-CoV, bat CoVs, and circulating human CoVs, making this nucleotide prodrug an effective pan-CoV inhibitor candidate (51) . It will be interesting to assess if the ribose 1\u2032-cyanyl group is also a determinant of resistance to ExoN activity.",

The percentage of active enzyme was estimated at <10% using titration of primer/template with increasing enzyme concentrations and manual burst analysis. Reactions were performed at 30\u00b0C using indicated concentrations of either one NTP, Rbv-TP (Jena Bioscience), or all NTPs (at 500 \u03bcM each). For incorrect nucleotides, product formation followed a linear increase of incorporation product up to 20 min, and 18 min was chosen as a suitable time for steady-state kinetic studies. Reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (formamide with 10 mM EDTA). RNA polymerization products were analyzed in polyacrylamide/7 M urea gels. RNA products were visualized using photostimulated plates and a phosphorimager (Fuji).",

Indeed, to prevent dsRNA product degradation by the highly potent nsp10/nsp14-ExoN activity(30), the RNA template bears only a single G at its 5\u2032-end. In the polymerase reaction, only ATP, UTP, GTP and 3\u2032-dCTP are provided as substrates for RNA synthesis. Hence, when the radiolabeled LS3 primer is extended by the polymerase complex, only 3\u2032-dCMP can be incorporated at the 3\u2032-end of the extended primer, preventing nsp10/nsp14-ExoN-mediated degradation of newly synthesized dsRNA(30). Part of the primer is shown with the same color code as the sequencing of the extended primer presented in C.
