            "text": "In this paper, a susceptible-vaccinated-exposed-infectious-recovered (SVEIR) epidemic model for an infectious disease that spreads in the host population through horizontal transmission is investigated, assuming that the horizontal transmission is governed by an unspecified function f (S, I). The role that temporary immunity (vaccinated-induced) and treatment of infected people play in the spread of disease, is incorporated in the model. The basic reproduction number R 0 is found, under certain conditions on the incidence rate and treatment function. It is shown that the model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, it is observed that the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium depends on R 0 as well as on the treatment rate. If R 0 > 1, then the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable with the help of the Li and Muldowney geometric approach applied to four dimensional systems. Numerical simulations are also presented to illustrate our main results. MSC: 92D25; 92D30; 34D23; 37B25",

In recent years, a lot of efforts have been made to develop realistic diseases and further study the asymptotic behavior of such epidemic models [5] . In the field of studying epidemic model behavior, one of the most important parts is to analyze steady states together with their stability [6] . In general, there are two distinct techniques named Lyapunov's direct method and Li-Muldowney's geometric approach to give sufficient conditions of global stability for the equilibrium states (see, for example, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ). We would like to mention some related work concerned with the existence of positive solutions for the discrete fractional boundary value problem [15] , the sensitivity analysis for optimal control problems governed by nonlinear evolution inclusions [16] and the nonexistence of global in time solution of the mixed problem for the nonlinear evolution equation with memory generalizing the Voigt-Kelvin rheological model [17] .",

The rise and fall of epidemics can be influenced by some factors, such as density of population and life style [18, 19] . Many researchers have adopted different nonlinear incidence rates in their works. For more details, we refer the reader to [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] and the references therein. When it comes to control of a disease, it is generally known that the spread of many diseases can be prevented by vaccinating. When massive vaccination is impossible, the second stage of defensive mechanism could be medical treatment. Individuals need to bear in mind that the treatment is an indispensable way to take precautions for some diseases (for instance, measles, phthisis and influenza). In recent years, many treatment functions have been introduced by several authors to study some epidemic models under different conditions (see, for instance, [12, 14, 27, 31, [35] [36] [37] [38] ).",

The transmission of the infection is governed by the incidence rate f (S, I) and \u03bc is birth rate as well as the death rate of the susceptible class. The nonlinear function g(I) denotes the sum of the death rate and the recovery rate for the infected individuals satisfying g(0) = 0 and g(I) > 0 for I > 0. Using a Dulac function approach, which aims at eliminating the existence of the periodic solution and proving the global stability by the Poincar\u00e9-Bendixson theorem (see [39] , p. 54), they obtained the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium for system (1.1).

The important mathematical findings for the dynamical behavior of model (1.3) have also numerically been verified for a special case of model (1.3). We would like to point out that the model considered in this paper is not a case study and so it is difficult to choose parameter values from quantitative estimation. We have used hypothetical sets of parameters to verify our analytical results. It is worth to mention that the results presented in this paper improve and extend some related results in [9, 10, 12, 13] . Finally, we remark that there are quite a few spaces to deserve further investigation. For example, we can continue the research in this line considering the vaccination rate \u03bc in our model (1.3) as a continuous function, and, later, a discontinuous function. On the other hand, as is well known, epidemiological models which incorporate the control strategies can be useful to both control the spread of disease and minimize the intervention costs. For our model, it is natural to consider vaccination rate coefficient as a control to reduce the disease burden. Thus, it is important and interesting to prove the existence of optimal control, characterize the optimal control, prove the uniqueness of optimal control, compute the optimal control numerically and investigate how the optimal control depends on various parameters in the models. We will devote to these questions our future work.",
