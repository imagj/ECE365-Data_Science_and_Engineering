Compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 has lower mortality, a stronger occult nature, and a greater transmission capacity. 2 Like the former two, COVID-19 can be transmitted through the respiratory tract and by contact and has evidence of humanhuman transmission. Another possible transmission route, fecal-oral transmission, has not been confirmed.",

(2) Only a positive diagnosis can be made, but the severity of COVID-19 and its progression cannot be judged (in contrast, CT imaging can reveal disease progression). ( 3) The supply of the reagents cannot keep up with the demand, and the quality of new products of major companies awaits to be studied and improved. (4) It takes 1 day or longer to obtain the results after sampling. For these reasons, Chinese researchers strongly recommend CT imaging as the main basis for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the current situation. 4 An academician of the American Society for Radiation Oncology called for the immediate establishment of a CT-based diagnostic method for COVID-19 and improvement of the detection rate of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 5 If a patient with clinically suspected COVID-19 has negative NAAT results but positive imaging results, the patient should be isolated and treated as soon as possible. The advantage of CT examination in the diagnosis of COVID-19 is obvious. Below, we analyze some typical patients who were examined and diagnosed by our institution.",

            "text": "Currently, 90% to 95% of the medical imaging examinations for suspected patients with COVID-19 are chest CT, which has a high detection rate of viral pneumonia. In contrast, the quality of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kits differs greatly, and the reliability of NAAT is still questionable. Moreover, NAAT has a low detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 and thus needs to be repeated 2 to 3 times in many cases. Some patients had negative NAAT results for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from pharyngeal swabs but positive NAAT results for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from bronchoalveolar lavage, leading to false-negative results. Second, the number of people awaiting NAATs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 greatly exceeds the capacity of medical institutions. Many patients have not been diagnosed in a timely manner and thus have missed the chance of early isolation and early treatment. Compared with various limitations of NAAT, chest CT examination is timely and rapid and has a high positive rate. 1 The extent of lung lesions is closely related to clinical symptoms. Therefore, chest CT examination is irreplaceable in the preliminary screening of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 has different imaging manifestations at different stages, which are mainly related to pathogenesis. The lesions at the early stage of COVID-19 are relatively localized and mainly manifest as inflammatory infiltration restricted to the subpleural or peribronchovascular regions of one lung or both lungs, exhibiting patchy or segmental pure GGOs with vascular dilation (Figure 1 ). Very few cases have negative CT findings at the early stage. In the progressive stage, CT shows mainly an increased range of pure GGOs (Figure 2) , the involvement of multiple lobes (Figure 3) , consolidations of some lesions, and GGOs surrounding consolidated lesions (the characteristic change of the progressive stage). Interlobular septal thickening and an obvious crazy-paving pattern are often present, and air bronchograms are common (Figure 4) . At the advanced stage, the CT manifestations of patients are similar to those in other types of pneumonia and mainly include diffuse lesions in both lungs, which are mostly consolidated lesions, and GGOs surrounding consolidated lesions, which are mostly accompanied by parenchymal bands and occasionally by a small amount of pleural effusion. This CT appearance is called lung whiteout. Different imaging manifestations at different stages may be associated with the pathological mechanism of viral pneumonia, which at first is prone to affect the terminal bronchioles and their surrounding pulmonary parenchyma and then develop into infiltration of pulmonary lobules and, lastly, diffuse alveolar damage. 6 In imaging diagnosis, COVID-19 is difficult to distinguish from pneumonias caused by influenza A virus, influenza B virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV, MERS coronavirus, and other viral pneumonias as well as bacterial pneumonia. 2 Luckily, their treatment methods are similar. There are no medicines specifically targeting COVID-19. Viral pneumonias other than COVID-19 mainly manifest as peribronchial and perivascular interstitial inflammation that moves toward the inner part of the pulmonary interstitium, and their CT manifestations are multiple interlaced or parallel high-attenuation fibrous streaks or highattenuation reticular patterns caused by infiltration of the interlobular septa. The lesions mainly occur in the hilar and subpleural regions. 7 If the pneumonia is secondary to bronchitis and does not involve the alveoli, inflammation often further develops into the bronchial wall. When the bronchioles are partially or completely blocked, CT images show localized pulmonary edema and/or atelectasis. The occurrence of viral pneumonia is correlated with the virulence of the virus, the transmission route, and the age and immunological status of the host. In general, the incidence of viral pneumonias is higher in children than in adults. In contrast, COVID-19 commonly occurs in 40-to 60-year-old patients with multiple comorbidities. Compared to patients with SARS and MERS, patients with COVID-19 have no obvious complications or infections, and the disease progression is relatively slow. 8 Coronavirus disease 2019 also needs to be differentiated from bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia (MPP), and chlamydia pneumonia. 9 Bacterial pneumonia occurs in the lung parenchyma and mainly manifests as bronchial pneumonia or lobar pneumonia with many inflammatory secretions in the bronchioles and alveoli. Its CT manifestations are mainly extensive patchy consolidations of the lung parenchyma, and GGOs are less common. Mycoplasma pneumonia commonly occurs in school-age children and adolescents but rarely occurs in adults. The chest CT findings of MPP in adults are mostly bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodules; bronchial wall thickening is considered the manifestation of lobular pneumonia, and centrilobular nodules are small airway lesions. The proportion of lung consolidation is as high as 61% in MMP. In contrast, CT manifestations of COVID-19 are mainly pure GGOs at the early stage and visible consolidations in the center of the lesions at the progressive stage, but the proportion of consolidations in COVID-19 is less than that in MMP. In addition, COVID-19 needs to be differentiated from lung disease caused by other diseases. 10 For example, the 2 suspected patients reported above were given completely different treatments, which mainly aimed to control pneumonia and primary diseases. Heart failure-induced pulmonary edema manifests differently at different stages of the disease. It can be divided into 2 subtypes: pulmonary alveolar edema (type I) and interstitial pulmonary edema (type II). Computed tomography manifestations of type I pulmonary edema mainly include local or multiple GGOs, patchy high-attenuation patterns, and large patchy high-attenuation patterns in both lungs, which typically exhibit the highattenuation butterfly sign with both hila as the center, accompanied by signs of interstitial pulmonary edema such as sporadic or local interlobular septal thickening. Computed tomography manifestations of type II pulmonary edema mainly include extensive or local interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, peribronchial cuffing, and redistribution of blood flow in both lungs, which may be accompanied by signs of pulmonary alveolar edema, including high-attenuation patterns such as GGOs. 11 Although various types of pneumonias have certain imaging features, COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias, bacterial pneumonia, and some lesions share some common imaging features. 12 In some cases, it is difficult to differentiate COVID-19 from them by imaging alone, and first clinical manifestations, contact history, and laboratory tests should also be considered to make the final diagnosis. The conclusions are listed in Table 1 .",

Therefore, it has great value in early screening, differential diagnosis, and disease severity assessment of COVID-19. For patients with fever as the first symptom and with a history of exposure to COVID-19, chest CT examination should be performed as soon as possible. If imaging shows the presence of typical manifestations of 2019-nCoV, even if the NAAT result for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is unavailable or negative, it is still necessary to take isolation measures to avoid the spread of the epidemic.",
