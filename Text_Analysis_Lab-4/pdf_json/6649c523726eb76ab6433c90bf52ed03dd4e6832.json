Prevention and case isolation are perhaps the most critical steps to prevent any given epidemic, and require active effort from authorities at all levels. These non-pharmacologic interventions play an important role in mitigating a community-wide epidemic, by 1) delaying the exponential growth of the curve, 2) reducing the number of cases, and 3) spreading the total demand over a longer period of time to match the capacity of hospitals and other healthcare settings (10) .",

Along with Brazilian authorities' efforts to improve the number of ICU beds during the COVID-19 outbreak, logistics need to be implemented to avoid contact between exposed and nonexposed patients. Non-life-threatening surgeries could be postponed until the epidemic is under control, both to avoid the risk of intercurrent COVID-19 infection and to guarantee ICU beds to critical patients. In cases with neoadjuvant treatment, the interval to surgery needs to be entered into the equation. It is estimated that 10% of patients affected by COVID-19 need prolonged admission in ICUs.
