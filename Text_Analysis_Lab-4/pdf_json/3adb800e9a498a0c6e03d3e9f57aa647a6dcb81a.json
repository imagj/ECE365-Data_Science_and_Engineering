This study aims to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards infectious diseases related to travel among community pharmacists in Italy. The data was collected from September 2018 to September 2019 using semi-structured telephone interviews. Only 1.8% answered correctly to all seven questions regarding the infectious diseases related to travel. Community pharmacists who had heard about travel medicine and those who had received information were more likely to have good knowledge. More than two-thirds of the respondents believed that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine. Pharmacists who worked a higher number of hours per week, were more knowledgeable about the more frequent infectious diseases related to travel, believed that travel medicine was a pharmacist competency, believed that they could give advice to the public, and had received information from scientific journals and educational activities were more likely to have this positive attitude. More than two-thirds often/always informed the public about the importance of having travel health center counseling. Pharmacists who had heard about travel medicine and those who believed that they could give advice to the public were more likely to inform. Interventions are needed to improve knowledge in order that community pharmacists can play an active role in counseling the public.",

In particular, primary care providers should be familiar with destination-specific disease risks, be knowledgeable in pre-travel health advice in order to reduce the risks for travelers, be prepared to prescribe and recommend medications for treatment that can be taken during the trip, and be able to identify those who might need additional follow-up after the trip [3] . Among healthcare professionals, pharmacists potentially have an important role in travel medicine within the community, and they are able to provide useful insights. In Italy, community pharmacists have a primary role also in providing recommendations to patients on the use of the healthcare services, and they can sell over-the-counter drugs to the public without medical counseling. Indeed, pharmacists can be one of the most common sources of healthcare information as they are closer to home and individuals often seek their services directly without consulting traveler medical centers. Therefore, pharmacists should be highly educated about travel medicine, since they could influence their own choices and those of the individuals they encounter.",

The first part consisted of the participants' socio-demographic and professional characteristics and included questions regarding their age, gender, marital status, year of graduation, number of years in practice, and practice size. The second part consisted of questions related to the pharmacists' knowledge about infectious diseases related to travel. Fourteen main infectious diseases selected according to the most frequently visited countries by the Italian population [5, [18] [19] [20] [21] were listed and pharmacists had to self-evaluate their knowledge giving their answers by choosing one of the three options: \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Don't know\". The scale was then dichotomized (\"Yes\" = 1 and \"No\"/\"Don't know\" = 0) and the total knowledge score for each participant was computed by adding up the scores (maximum score of 14). The total score was then categorized as poor knowledge (score of \u22642), moderate knowledge (score of 3-4), and good knowledge (score \u22655). The third part assessed participants' attitudes with three statements on the importance of travel medicine for their work activity, asking whether they agreed that travel medicine is a pharmacist competency and whether they should give advice regarding travel medicine as part of their work activity, with response options on a 5-level Likert scale ranging from \"Strongly disagree\" to \"Strongly agree\", and whether they believed that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine, with the response on a numerical 10-point Likert scale with higher values corresponding to a stronger attitude. The fourth part collected information about their practice and communication with the public regarding travel medicine. Three responses were collected on a 5-level Likert scale ranging from \"Never\" to \"Always\" and the others through multiple-choice alternatives. The fifth part included two questions on whether respondents had received information about travel medicine and whether they had educational needs.",

First, descriptive analyses were performed to assess all characteristics of the participants. Second, chi-square and Student's t-test were conducted to examine the relationship between the independent variables and the outcomes of interest. Third, multivariate ordered, linear, and logistic regression analysis was conducted by including in the models the variables with a p-value \u2264 0.25 at the bivariate analysis in order to estimate the independent association between potential predictors and the outcomes of interest. The following three models were developed: (1) pharmacists' level of knowledge about the more frequent infectious diseases related to travel (poor = 1; moderate = 2; good = 3) (Model 1); (2) pharmacists who believed that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine (continuous) (Model 2); (3) pharmacists who often or always inform the public about the importance of having travel health center counseling (no = 0; yes = 1) (Model 3). Initial candidate variables included in all models were age (continuous), gender (male = 0; female = 1), marital status (unmarried/separated/divorced/widowed = 0; married = 1), number of years since degree (continuous), number of years in practice (continuous), number of hours worked per week (continuous), employment type (owner = 1; employee = 2; director = 3), having heard about travel medicine (no = 0; yes = 1), sources of information on travel medicine (none = 1; scientific journals and educational activities = 2; Internet and mass media = 3), and need of additional information on travel medicine (no = 0; yes = 1). Moreover, the following variables were also included: pharmacists' level of knowledge about the more frequent infectious diseases related to travel (poor = 1; moderate = 2; good = 3), pharmacists who believed that travel medicine is a pharmacist competency (strongly disagree/disagree/uncertain = 0; agree/strongly agree = 1), pharmacists who believed that they could give advice to the public about travel medicine (strongly disagree/disagree/uncertain = 0; agree/strongly agree = 1) in Models 2 and 3, and pharmacists who believed that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine (continuous) in Model 3. A stepwise backward procedure was used to select which variables to include in the final models and in order to find the most parsimonious models. P-values of 0.2 and 0.4 were considered as a threshold to include and to eliminate variables. Odds ratios (ORs) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using ordered and logistic regression. Standardized regression coefficients (\u03b2) were presented for the linear regression models. All tests were two-sided with p-values less than or equal to 0.05 considered statistically significant.",

The finding that respondents had a lack of knowledge is in accordance with previous reports, which have shown that community pharmacists have a knowledge gap and low confidence in providing this type of care [15, 23] . This fact emphasizes the importance that pharmacists should be informed since their level of awareness should primarily be improved. Moreover, pharmacists who had a higher level of knowledge were far more likely to believe that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine and to inform them about the potential risks of travel diseases and the importance of having travel health center counseling before their departure.

A similar result was observed among Malaysian community pharmacists who agreed that they are in a position to provide health information and recommendations regarding travel health [7] . This is a relevant finding because pharmacists should give advice to patients in order to guarantee the appropriate behaviors before and during their travels and they may be a key and trusted source of information. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that pharmacists who believed that knowledge about travel medicine is a part of their role were more likely to believe that it is important that they provide information to the public. This result can be explained by the fact that pharmacists who had this attitude were more likely to acquire information because they thought travel medicine was a key professional skill. Therefore, policy makers and healthcare managers should implement programs that actively involve the pharmacists because pharmaceutical services are available throughout the territory and can easily be accessed, and this could lead to a greater adherence of the public to preventive measures and may contribute to patient safety and appropriate use of medications.",

This underlined the availability of the community pharmacists in providing information to the public regarding travel diseases.

This result is in line with those of a similar study conducted in Australia that showed that pharmacists had a role in advising travelers, who would not normally visit a physician before travelling, on travel-related health issues before visiting certain destinations [24] . Furthermore, the result of the logistic regression analysis showed that the positive attitude of the study participants about different health seeking behaviors predicted their real practices since those who believed that they could give advice to the public regarding travel medicine were more likely to often or always inform the public about the importance of having travel health center counselling than those who did not.",

Indeed, as described in prior studies [5, 17, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , it is evident from the multivariate analysis that receiving information from scientific journals and educational activities facilitates the emergence of pharmacists who have better knowledge and have more positive attitudes. This is important because the pharmacists themselves, in order to effectively influence others, must be well equipped with an appropriate level of knowledge, and interventions should be aimed at including such sources as an important conduit of travel medicine-related information, which can support the pharmacists' confidence. However, an unsurprising finding was that a large majority of pharmacists identified the Internet as being their main source of information, rather than the medical establishment. It should be underlined that several studies have expressed concern about the quality and accuracy of health information on the web [30] [31] [32] , and, therefore, it may not provide all of the details necessary to allow the pharmacists to make well-informed suggestions. Consequently, it is possible that there are missed opportunities for pharmacists to provide high quality information. Health information via the Internet should not replace other healthcare professional experts in travel medicine who can give advice for specific situations. Furthermore, the vast majority of responders felt they did not have sufficient information to adequately answer questions on this field. Clear communication and knowledge about travel medicine would help to instill confidence in pharmacists and keep them adequately informed in order to meet the needs of their community, as well as enable them to discuss any concerns with their customers that may arise from what their customers have read. Therefore, pharmacists must have the capacity needed to effectively educate and address public questions and concerns since the delivery of information from a trusted or known source with which the individual has already developed a relationship may be beneficial. This is crucial also in light of the measures taken for the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by the Italian authorities [33] , as pharmacists represent an important element in order to provide appropriate recommendations to the public about preventive measures.",

First, the cross-sectional design of this study can only demonstrate associations between the different outcomes of interest and the observed determinants, and it is not possible to say anything about causality. Second, data collection through the telephone survey was based on self-reported information, and so may be subject to reporting bias. Third, there is also the risk for social desirability bias, by which participants do not report attitudes and behaviors fully or accurately and may provide the responses they believe the researcher wants to know instead of the truth, as opposed to answering honestly, and it is possible that they may over-report socially desirable attitudes and behaviors or under-report socially undesirable attitudes and behaviors. Efforts were made to minimize the risk of these biases by ensuring participants that the study was anonymous and confidential and that their data would be de-identified. Fourth, it is possible that pharmacists with specific positive or negative opinions or interest in the topic were more or less likely to respond to the survey. If such bias exists, it may lead to an over-or underrepresentation of the rate of positive responses. However, the high response rate could offset this bias. Moreover, no difference has been observed between respondents and non-respondents regarding the geographic area of activity.",
