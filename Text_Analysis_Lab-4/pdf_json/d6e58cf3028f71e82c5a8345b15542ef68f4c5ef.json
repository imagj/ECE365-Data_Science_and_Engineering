With 100% of the detection rate, 250 copies/mL of HBV RNA were potentially considered as the limit of detection, though the focus of our study was not to prove the best detection limit for the HBV RNA assay. RNA assays were evaluated using HBV RNA specimens at the concentration of 5\u00d710 2 and 5\u00d710 3 , whose results were illustrated in red and blue, respectively. Tests upon each specimen were repeated for 20 times. Coefficients of variability for HBV RNA at concentrations of 5\u00d710 2 and 5\u00d710 3 were 2.09% and 1.56%, respectively. For HBV RNA at 250 copies/mL, we also demonstrated the amplification curves and characterized the coefficient of variation, defined by the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. Given 120 individual tests, the CV value of specimens harboring HBV RNA at concentrations of 250 copies/mL was 4.84% (see Figure S 7 , PCR raw data is available in the supplementary file).

Experiments were designed to prove this result under four conditions: (a) HBV RNA negative and DNA negative; (b) HBV RNA negative and DNA positive; (c) HBV RNA positive and DNA negative; (d) HBV RNA positive and DNA positive. First, we conducted experiments to validate the HBV RNA detection system under the first three conditions: (a) TE buffer (pH=8.0); (b) HBV DNA standard at a high concentration (10 9 IU/mL) in the absence of HBV RNA; (c) HBV RNA standard (concentration: 5\u00d710 8 copies/mL) in the absence of HBV DNA. As illustrated in Figure S 4, neither the signals of the TE buffer (a) nor the signals of the HBV DNA standard in the absence of HBV RNA (b) were detected, whereas signals of HBV RNA standard in the absence of HBV DNA (c) were detected successfully. Next, we evaluated the condition (d) in which HBV RNA and DNA were in samples treated with or without DNase I. Results are shown inTable S6. Under the conditions of HBV DNA levels from 5.7 to 8.7 log10 IU/mL, we compared samples treated with or without DNase I (n=10), and no significant difference of HBV RNA was found in samples treated with or without DNase (p>0.05, Table S 6). In conclusion, four experiments above suggest that the RNA detection approach could successfully detect signals of HBV RNA no matter whether samples are treated with DNase I or not, and HBV RNA detection is unlikely influenced by the high concentration of HBV DNA.",

The linear regression curve maps the standard curve along with HBV RNA in the concentrations from 5\u00d710 2 copies/mL (log10 value: 2.699) to 5\u00d710 9 copies/mL (log10 value: 9.699). The correlation coefficient was -3.479002 with R 2 =0.999. Note that delta Rn value is the Rn value of experimental reaction minus the Rn value of the baseline signal. Cycle threshold (Ct) is the intersection between an amplification curve and a threshold line.",
