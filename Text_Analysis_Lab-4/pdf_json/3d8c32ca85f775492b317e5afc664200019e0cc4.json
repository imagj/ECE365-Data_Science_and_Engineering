This truncated distribution is most likely a more accurate estimate of the true distribution, which is why it was used in the analysis reported in the main text. However, for completeness, we present the difference in the two distributions here [ Figure S1 ] and the effect the difference in distribution has on the results of the cCFR and cIFR calculated on the cruise ship [ Table S1 ]. As was to be expected, a shorter mean delay produces fewer corrected for \"known outcomes\", meaning that the correction doesn't increase the na\u00efve estimate by as much. Therefore, using the truncated distribution (with a higher mean and standard deviation) in the calculation results in higher values for the cCFR and cIFR.",

Arguably the largest such bias is the underreporting of cases, which is inevitable in a country with an overwhelmed healthcare. To this end, we treat the ratio between the CFR calculated based on the observed number of deaths on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and the expected number (if the nCFR in China had been true on the cruise ship) as the scaling factor by which we adjust the China data. In doing so, we are able to use all of the information in their age-stratified data with a high sample size along with the information in our CFR estimates calculated in a setting with no underreporting bias.",

[1] and by calculating the estimates using both the truncated and non-truncated distributions. This is an inexact and indirect way to test the sensitivity of the estimates against this assumption.

Since there have been a further two deaths and 62 more cases. We are entering the phase where the correction does not need to correct for much, given that most outcomes are now known. This gives us a unique opportunity to test our corrected value against the na\u00efve calculation, which after enough time should converge. We find that using the current available data, the nIFR: 1.6% (CI 95%: 0.79%-2.8%), which is consistent with our more accurate estimate calculated using the truncated distribution for all ages. ",
