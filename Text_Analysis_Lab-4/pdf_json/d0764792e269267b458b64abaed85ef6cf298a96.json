During an outbreak, the so-called naive CFR (nCFR), i.e. the ratio of reported deaths date to reported cases to date, will underestimate the true CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) is not known for all cases [5, 6] , assuming all cases are detected. We can estimate the true denominator for the CFR (i.e. the number of cases with known outcomes) by accounting for (Table 2) using data from the outbreak in Wuhan, China. The distribution has a mean of 13 days and standard deviation of 12.7 days. Case and death time-series data is as reported until 5 March 2020 and is taken from [8] . Nine negative cases on 5 March were removed from the figure for aesthetic purposes. However, they were included in the analysis.",

Given that asymptomatic infections are typically not reported, especially during an ongoing outbreak of a novel infection, this correction is normally used to calculate the cCFR. However, because of the high level of testing on the cruise ship, we were able to use this correction to calculate the corrected IFR (cIFR). After that, we used the measured proportions of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases on the Diamond Princess to scale the cIFR to estimate the cCFR.

This produced a total of 15.15 expected deaths, which corresponds to a nCFR estimate of 5% (15.15/301) for the Diamond Princess (Table 2) , which falls within the top end of our 95% CI. As our cCFR for Diamond Princess was 2.6% (95% CI: 0.89-6.7), this suggests we need to multiply the nCFR estimates in China [7] by a factor 52% (95% CI: 14-100) to obtain the correct value. As the raw overall nCFR reported in the data from China was 2.3% [10] , this suggests the cCFR in China during that period was 1.2% (95% CI: 0.3-3.1) and the IFR was 0.6% (95% CI: 0.2-1.7). Based on cases and deaths reported in China up to 4 March 2020, the nCFR calculation was considerably higher than the cCFR we estimate here (based on data taken from [8] , nCFR = 2,984/80,422 = 3.71% (95% CI: 3.58-3.84)). The confidence intervals calculated for China using an indirect standardisation method reflect the uncertainty in the Diamond Princess estimates, as it is carried forward in the scaling.
