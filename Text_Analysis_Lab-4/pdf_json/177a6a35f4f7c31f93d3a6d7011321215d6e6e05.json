            "text": "By the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent of an outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, province of Hubei, in China. The virus had a rapid dissemination, with person-to-person transmission and cases soon identified throughout the world. The disease was called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), with several new outbreaks related to community transmission. It is now classified as pandemic. (1) (2) (3) (4) We have observed an increase in requests of chest computed tomography (CT) since the first records of cases in Brazil; therefore, in a near future, the current installed capacity of the system to analyze and produce the CT reports may be exceeded. It is crucial to highlight that the definite diagnosis of COVID-19 is made by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and a normal (negative) chest CT does not rule out diagnosis. However, currently, the RT-PCR result has taken longer than CT reports to be available, so CT has taken an important role in a comprehensive assessment of patients, for demonstrating high sensitivity (although low specificity), to detect the most frequent pulmonary findings of the disease.",

We also included an approximate estimate of extent of pulmonary involvement by the disease (visual analysis), which has been considered useful by them in management of patients, together with other clinical data and physical examination. In our Institution, involvement of >50% of parenchyma (5) has been used as an additional criterion to decide for hospitalization.",
