            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an evolving and dynamic virus that causes major economic losses for the poultry industry worldwide. Continuous evolution and emergence of new variants of this virus are the major challenges for controlling the disease with routine vaccination. Successful vaccination usually requires the use of a homologous vaccine, which in turn necessitates continuous investigation of the circulating strains. Herein, we performed a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-(RT-PCR-) based investigation in broiler chicken flocks of the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. IBV was detected in 36.5% of the tested flocks (42 out of 115) from January 2012 to March 2014. Direct sequencing of hypervariable region-3 (HVR-3) of the Spike (S)-1 gene was performed, followed by phylogenetic analysis to determine the circulating IBV genotypes. Four lineages appear to coexist in this region, including the GI-13 or 4/91 IBV (31%), GI-16 or CK/CH/LDL/97I IBV (28.6%), GI-1 or Mass IBV (19%), and GI-23 or Middle East IBV (21.4%). e latter lineage include two subgroups: IS/720/99 IBV (16.7%) and IS/ Variant2/98 IBV (4.7%). Some of the detections made in the 4/91 and Mass lineages are expected to belong to the vaccine strains. Lineages without a homologous vaccine in use (CK/CH/LDL/97I and Middle East) represent 50% of the isolates recovered in this study. Based on identity with the vaccine sequences, field observations, and frequent detection, these two lineages appear to be out of coverage of the IBV vaccines used in Saudi Arabia. is is the first time to identify Middle East lineage (IS/720/99 IBV and IS/ Variant2/98 IBV) in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) that is present in virtually all regions with an intensive poultry industry. In addition to respiratory involvement, IB may also affect the urogenital and/or alimentary tracts. IB causes significant economic losses by adversely affecting weight gain and the quality and quantity of produced eggs as well as predisposing birds to secondary infections [1] . e causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), belongs to group III Coronaviruses of family Coronaviridae. IBV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positivesense RNA genome of approximately 27.6 kb. Four structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)) were reported to be encoded by the IBV genome [2] . e glycosylated S protein is posttranslationally cleaved by cellular proteases into S1, which forms the spike bulb, and S2, which anchors S1 to the virion membrane. e S1 and S2 subunits have been shown to mediate viral attachment and membrane fusion, respectively. Virus neutralizing epitopes are located in the first and third quarters of the S1 glycoprotein [2, 3] . ree hypervariable regions (HVR)-1, 2, and 3 were reported to be located in the S1 subunit between amino acids 38 to 67, 91 to 141, and 274 to 387, respectively [4] . Genetic variability of these HVRs due to mutations and/or recombination was incriminated in the continuous emergence of new IBV serotypes/genotypes [5] . In this regard, substitution of 10 to 15 amino acids (2-3%) in the S1 subunit has been shown to result in generation of a new serotype [6] .",

Vaccination is the primary measure used to control IBV infection, but caution must be taken when choosing a vaccine strain(s) that should be homologous with the circulating IBV serotype(s). Vaccination-challenge studies have shown that protection by heterologous vaccines ranges between very poor to moderate depending on the criteria used. Poor cross protection may be induced by as little as a 5% difference in the S1 amino acid sequence, while most IBV serotypes differ from each other by 20-25% and up to 50% [6] . Accordingly, S1 nucleotide sequence similarity and genotyping approaches have been used successfully to predict cross-protection and circulating serotypes, with some exceptions [8, 9] . Recently, IBV was genotyped based on S1 sequences into 6 major genotypes (Genotype I (GI) to GVI] containing 32 lineages [10] .",

Vaccine strains belonging to this serotype and the Mass serotype (GI-1 lineage), such as H120 and Ma5, are in use to control IB occurrence; however, IB still occurs due to the CH/CK/LDL/ 97I (GI-16) lineage, the Middle East (GI-23) lineage (IS/720/ 99 and IS/Variant2/98), and D274 (GI-12) lineage [13, 14] .

In the present study, we report the IBV lineages circulating in 115 broiler chicken flocks in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. e reaction was performed using the previously published primers N784, N1145, N791, and N1129 [17] , which were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) and presented in Table 1 . e nested PCR reactions were performed using the Go Taq \u00ae Green Master Mix (Cat #M7122, Promega) in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl containing the primers at a final concentration of 0.8 \u03bcM with 2 \u03bcl of the template cDNA. e Bio-Rad T-100 ermal Cycler was used to perform an amplification reaction that consisted of 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes and 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1 minute, and 72\u00b0C for 2 minutes, followed by a final extension step of 72\u00b0C for 7 minutes. A similar thermal profile was used for the second round of the nested PCR except that the annealing step was performed at 53\u00b0C for 1 minute and the extension step lasted for 1 minute and 10 minutes for the cyclic and final extension steps, respectively. e second-round PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel in Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer.

Likewise, a vaccination-challenge experiment showed that 6 Veterinary Medicine International heterologous vaccines did not provide sufficient protection against CK/CH/LDL/97I IBV. In contrast, complete protection was provided by a homologous vaccine derived from the same type and attenuated by passaging in embryonated hen eggs [34] . In Saudi Arabia, the high prevalence of this lineage in broiler chickens appears to be facilitated by an immunity gap created by use of only heterologous vaccines. A similar scenario was suggested for spread of the IT-02 IBV strain in Spanish 4/91-vaccinated flocks [9] . e 4/91 (G1-13) lineage was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2000 [12] . In the present investigation, the 4/91 lineage was detected at a rate of 31% in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2014. Similarly, it was the most prevalent lineage with a detection rate of 43% in Saudi Arabia during the period from 2009 to 2014 [14] and had reported detection rates of 40% and 50% in Iraq [26, 31] , 64% and 81% in Oman, and 85% in the UAE [14, 33] . e 4/91 lineage was also the second most prevalent lineage in Iran (19% and 27%), Egypt (17%), and Lebanon (13%) but was undetectable in Jordan and Kuwait [14, 29, 30] .",

Conversely, four of these nine flocks received only the Mass vaccine, and the vaccination history was not available for the ninth flock. Keeping in mind that approximately 70% of the 4/91-like sequences were vaccineidentical, and this lineage contains some isolates that displayed relatively high sequence divergence (Table 3) . Heavy vaccine application may contribute to such divergence, as previously suggested by Lee and Jackwood [35] . In contrast, the CK/CH/LDL/97I lineage showed the lowest divergence, which could further support our justification of the low immune pressure exerted by the used vaccines on CK/CH/ LDL/97I lineage viruses.",

On the contrary, two out of the eight Mass isolates showed incomplete identity with Mass vaccines (SA/IH20/13 and SA/IC79/13).

A vaccination-challenge experiment showed that the H120 vaccine provided little protection against IS/720/99 [37] . Over the sequenced region in the present study, genetic relatedness between the IS/720/99-like isolates and the Ma5 or 4/91 vaccines was not better than that with H120. erefore, we can rationally expect poor cross-protection with these heterologous vaccines. e other subdivision of the Middle East (GI-23) lineage detected in this study was the IS/Variant2/98 IBV. Our data showed that the IS/Variant2/98 IBV had the lowest prevalence (4.7%) in Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. From 2009 to 2014, a prevalence of 11% was reported in Saudi Arabia and 4% in Egypt, and the strain was not detected in the UAE [14] . Similarly, variable prevalence rates of 21% and 3% were reported in Oman during overlapping periods from 2009 to 2014 and during 2012, respectively [14, 33] . In contrast, this strain was reported to be the most prevalent in the neighboring north countries, including prevalence rates of 100% in Jordan and Kuwait; 82% in Lebanon; 67%, 70%, and 75% in Iran; and 47% in Iraq [14, [29] [30] [31] 38] . e two isolates within the IS/Variant2/98 subdivision reported in this study were recovered from two Mass-vaccinated broiler flocks. Based on reported field observations of H120-vaccinated flocks [39] and sequence similarity of the detected isolates with available vaccines (Mass and 4/91), which showed \u226483% sequence identity (Table 3) , these vaccines seem unlikely to be able to provide protection against IS/variant2-like strains.",

Likewise, other lineages were reported in surrounding countries but not in Saudi Arabia or vice versa; for example, the QX (or GI- 19) lineage was detected at rates of 7% and 8% in Iran and 9% in Iraq [29] [30] [31] . Similarly, Ganapathy and colleagues (2015) detected the D274 (or GI-12) lineage at a frequency of once out of 236 samples during the period from 2009 to 2014, whereas we did not detect this lineage at the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia during the period from 2012 to 2014. Similarly, the CK/CH/LDL/97I lineage was prevalent in Saudi Arabia but not in surrounding countries.

Advantages and disadvantages of full and partial sequencing of IBV-S1 gene was previously reported [53] . According to the phylogenetic analysis of the partial (HVR-3) S1 gene sequences published by Valastro et al.

Indeed, Valastro et al. specify 8 lineages (GI-5, -7, -10, -18, -22, -24, -25, and -27) that loss their unity in phylogeny when using the partial 342 nt. encoding the HVR3 [10] .

Four IBV lineages were found to cocirculate in this region. Half of the detected isolates belong to two of these lineages (CK/CH/LDL/97I and Middle East) against which no homologues vaccines are available, and these lineages are expected to keep causing IBV outbreaks and economic losses in the absence of such vaccines. Further studies to elucidate the serotypic, pathotypic, and protectotypic properties of the endemic types are required. Continuous monitoring of the IBV types circulating in Saudi Arabia as well as continuous update of the vaccination strategy seem to be necessary to control IBV infection.",

Sampling and Nucleic Acid Extraction.e study was conducted between January 2012 and March 2014. Samples were collected from 115 broiler chicken flocks in the Eastern Region (Al-Hassa and Dammam) of Saudi Arabia by visiting broilers farms, broilers slaughterhouse, and the poultry clinic at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of King Faisal University. Tissue samples, such as trachea, lung, spleen, kidney, and bursa of Fabricius, were collected from birds showing signs of respiratory illness. Although not always successful, attempts were made to collect various organs and a complete history from the sampled flocks. For each flock, each organ was pooled together from all sampled birds. Tissue samples were collected in 10 volumes of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing gentamicin and nystatin (50 \u03bcg of each/ml). e samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until being homogenized. Homogenization was performed using the Omni International Ceramic bead kit and the Bio-SpecMini-Beadbeater-16 instrument. For each organ, viral nucleic acids were extracted from homogenized tissues with the IQEasy Plus Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (Cat #17153, iNtRON Biotechnology, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. e extracted nucleic acids were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until being tested by RT-PCR. e isolates were named according to the Cavanagh nomenclature system[16] that includes the country/sample name/ sampling year.2.3. Synthesis of cDNA.First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a Reverse Transcription System (Cat #A3500, Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. e reaction was performed in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl containing the following ingredients: 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1x RT buffer, 1 mM of each dNTP, 1 U/\u03bcl of Recombinant RNasin \u00ae Ribonuclease Inhibitor, 0.75 U/\u03bcl of AMV reverse transcriptase, 25 ng/\u03bcl of Random Primers, and 50 ng/\u03bcl of total RNA. e reaction mixture was incubated at 42\u00b0C for 45 minutes, followed by heat inactivation of the enzyme at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes and 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes. e cDNA was diluted with nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until being tested by PCR.2.4.
