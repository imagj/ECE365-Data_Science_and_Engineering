            "text": "Primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO) is the most common cause of epiphora in adults. 1 A variety of anatomical, endocrine, environmental, and socioeconomic risk factors have been suggested in the etiology; however, the precise pathogenesis of PANDO has not yet been elucidated. Previous histopathological studies have revealed chronic inflammation of the nasolacrimal duct and the development of secondary fibrosis on the ground of this inflammation. [2] [3] [4] PANDO has been reported to be able to occur secondary to unrecognized low-grade dacryocystitis. 5 In one experimental model of dacryocystitis, the number of collagen fibers and fibrocytes in the lamina propria had increased 3 months after a Staphylococcus aureus inoculation. 6 Viruses, as superior to bacteria, have capability to extend beyond the epithelium to involve the elastic tissue of the lamina propria, causing inflammation and cicatricial changes in the mucosa. 5 Recently, viral infections have been reported as the possible trigger factors in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, characterized by inflammation and secondary fibrosis in their histopathological examinations. [7] [8] [9] [10] A similar mechanism may be possible for the pathogenesis of PANDO which has common histopathological characteristics with these diseases.",

Similarly, viral conjunctivitis may easily extend into the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct mucosa in the direction of tear drainage.

RSV is a segmental, negatively polarized RNA virus. 15 It has the capability of affecting the cytokine production profile of adaptive immune system cells by shifting the T helper (Th) 1 / Th 2 balance toward Th 2 cytokines and immunoglobulin E. 16 It has also been shown to alter the biological activity of macrophages. 17 Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), a profibrotic enzyme has been shown to increase in the epithelium after an RSV infection. 18 When all these mechanisms are considered together, RSV has the capability to trigger inflammation and fibrosis development by both shifting the Th balance toward the production of the profibrotic cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, and increasing the synthesis of connective tissue enzymes, such as MMP-9. 18, 19 Adenovirus DNA was detected in the DCR biopsy specimen from one case and in the nasal swab sample from one case. Adenoviruses, which are common respiratory tract viruses with more than 50 serotypes, have been proven to cause latent infections, especially in lymphoid tissues. [20] [21] [22] Early region 1A, which is a viral gene product of adenoviruses, has been reported to promote the production of profibrotic mediators, such as connective tissue growth factor and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 mRNA on the bronchial epithelium. 23 In the case of a latent adenovirus infection, the continuous release of these profibrotic mediators may trigger fibrosis development. In addition, the nasolacrimal duct is surrounded by a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, which is believed to provide immunomodulation, and damage to this structure has been associated with the development of PANDO. 24, 25 Because adenoviruses have been proven to cause latent infections in lymphoid tissues, 22 a persistent viral infection in this special lymphoid tissue may lead to a chronic inflammatory process resulting in injury and scar formation.",

Sexual differences in cytokine responses to infection may also have a role in determining susceptibility to viruses. 27 Therefore, further studies including large number of cases with equal gender and age distribution and usage of quantitative real-time PCR analysis for suspected viruses to decide the clinical stage of the infection are needed. Animal models in which virus inoculation is performed directly into the lacrimal sac may also help to assess the mucosal changes that viruses can reveal in this region. Moreover, populationbased studies with a long follow-up time that evaluate the time period prior to the disease development may help to elucidate the precise pathogenesis of PANDO.",
