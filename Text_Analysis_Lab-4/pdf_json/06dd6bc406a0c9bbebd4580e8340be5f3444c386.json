The infection outbreak began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread throughout the world, including Brazil. On March 11 th , 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Now more than one million confirmed cases of COVID- 19 have been reported to the WHO, including more than 50,000 deaths. In Brazil, as of April 4 th , 2020, we have confirmed 10,278 infected patients and 432 deaths, and the numbers continue to increase.",

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in adults ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and fatal illness. The main clinical symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, and 10-20% of patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome after 8-14 days of the illness (3) . Based on data from more than 72,000 patients from China, 81% of the patients were mildly affected, 14% had severe manifestations, and 5% were critically ill. No deaths occurred in children younger than 9 years but the mortality rate ranged from 8-15% in those aged older than 70 years (4) . Risk factors for severe illness were older age and pre-existing comorbid conditions including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer. Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, but clinical manifestations were less severe compared to those seen in adults (5) . Around 6% of children suffered severe disease and life-threatening conditions, but these patients commonly had a prior history of congenital or acquired disease or were younger than 1 year (4, 5) .",

Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples and other clinical specimens, awareness has been raised regarding the management of patients with pre-existing digestive diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Special attention was also given to potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission via a fecal route (7, 8) . Following viral infection, virus-specific RNA and proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm to assemble new virions. The detection of viral RNA from feces 1 to 12 days after being negative in respiratory samples suggest that the viruses are continuously secreted from infected gastrointestinal cells (9) . The period of viral secretion from pediatric feces is longer than in adults (10) . These observations suggest that the inflamed gut of adults and children with IBD could be more susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 because it is a doorway for the virus (11, 12) .",

In the course of infusions, a distance of approximately 1.5 m between seats was considered safe and no accompanying person was permitted. Although we acknowledged that the use of surgical masks for immunodeficient patients is indicated, it was not always available. Thus, a screening protocol with an objective interview was implemented prior to admission to systematically assess for acute respiratory tract symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, or fever, among both IBD patients and their contacts. Asymptomatic patients received IV infusions as planned, while those with highly suspicious coronavirus infection were referred to the emergency room. In cases where initiation of biologics was extremely necessary, and when it was feasible, preference for those biologics that could be offered subcutaneously, at home, instead of intravenously, which would require an infusion center, was recommended.",

Facing these challenging circumstances, our group has adapted IBD care by resetting priorities, providing appropriate information for patients, and assuring continuity of treatments. Finally, it is of paramount importance to remember that in developing countries, a significant part of the population lives in precarious conditions, with crowding, slum dwelling, and lack of basic sanitation, among other unique features, which deserve special attention from health authorities and effective adaptations. It turns out that, in this scenario, especially in the case of IBD patients, treatment individualization is mandatory, and the benefits and disadvantages should always be taken into account.",
