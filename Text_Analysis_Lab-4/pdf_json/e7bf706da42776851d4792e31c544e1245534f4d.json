For dental practices and hospitals in areas that are (potentially) affected with COVID-19, strict and effective infection control protocols are urgently needed.

According to the epidemic situation, the notification of city lockdown was made to stop any transportation, including airplane, train, and bus, from Wuhan city to prevent COVID-19 transmission, especially because of population movement during Chinese Spring Festival. Before January 21, WHUSS staff had only medical masks and gloves. On January 22, we started to use disposable surgical masks, N95 masks, and gowns. Goggles and protective suits were not available until January 28. recommendations for dental education during an outbreak: First, during the outbreak period, online lectures, case studies, and problem-based learning tutorials should be adopted to avoid unnecessary aggregation of people and associated risk of infection (Patil et al. 2003) . Existing smart devices and applications have already made it possible for students to listen to and review lectures whenever and wherever possible. In fact, our students started online learning from February 17. Second, it is worth advocating to encourage students to engage in selflearning, make full use of online resources, and learn about the latest academic developments. Third, during this period, it is easy for students to be affected by disease-associated fear and pressure, and dental schools should be prepared to provide psychological services to those who need them (Wong et al. 2004) .",

As shown in the diagram, our triage staff in the yellow area wear disposable surgical mask, cap, and work clothes. In the orange area, dental staff is provided with PPE, including disposable N95 masks, gloves, gowns, cap, shoe cover, and goggles or face shield. The area is disinfected once every half day. Before February 21, all the patients were treated in this area. The isolation clinic in the red area was set up on February 21. It is designed for patients who are suspected with COVID-19, who are recovering from COVID-19 (but <1 mo after they are discharged from hospital), or who need dental procedures producing droplets and/or aerosols. Separate entrances for patients (red arrow) and staff (blue arrow) are provided in the area. Dental staff should wear protective clothing besides the aforementioned PPE. In addition, the entire isolation area is disinfected immediately after the treatment is over and the patient has left. The grid area behind the red line is for staff only. Staff can have a rest in the room (green area). They are recommended to enter the room by turn and to keep wearing medical masks unless they are eating or drinking. potential conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship and/or publication of this article.",
