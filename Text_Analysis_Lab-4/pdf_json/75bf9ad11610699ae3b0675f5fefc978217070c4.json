To deconvolute the contributions of amino acids and carbohydrates to the molecular weights of FIPV-UU4 S protein, the refractive index increments (dn/dc) of protein and protein conjugate (carbohydrates) were defined as 0.185 and 0.140 mL/g, respectively, as inputs for the molecular weight calculations by using the ASTRA 6.0 software (Wyatt Technology).

An ab initio 3D map was generated from the best 2D classes (102,586 particles) to serve as the input for 3D refinement. After the refinement routine within cisTEM, an EM map of 3.31 \u00c5 resolution was obtained, which was sharpened by using a Bfactor of -90 \u00c5 2 . The resolution of the map was estimated based on the gold-standard FSC = 0.143. Local resolution analysis was calculated using ResMap (8).

            "text": "Model building and refinement. The atomic model of FIPV-UU4 S protein was constructed using Phenix (12) and Coot (13) . First, an overall poly-alanine backbone was created within the EM density by Phenix. Sequence assignment was carried out manually using Coot, aided by manual inspection for aromatic side chains. A homology model was built using Swiss-Model (14) as a template for manual model building. By dividing the homology into individual domains and manually move them through rigid-body movements using Coot, an initial model was generated to enable subsequent model building that accounted for conformational changes in the loop regions and individual side-chain rotameric states. Finally, a convergent model was eventually generated, energy minimized and refined. N-linked glycan models were generated by using the extension module \"Glyco\" (15) within Coot. Generally, individual glycan moieties corresponding to the structures determined by MS-based glycopeptide analysis were manually built onto asparagine side-chains within the N-X-S/T motifs using the \"Linked Monosaccharide Addition (LMA)\" function of the Glyco module within Coot; the number of glycan moieties built on each glycosylation site depended on the extent of resolved electron densities protruding from the asparagine side-chain. The glycosidic linkages were created by pre-defined function of LMA. All glycan trees were refined by using the function \"Torsion fit & Refine this residue\" of Glyco. The geometries of individual N-glycan moieties were subsequently validated by Privateer (16, 17) . Iterative model refinements were carried out iteratively by using the real-space refinement of Phenix and Coot. The final model was assessed by MolProbity (18) and EMRinger (19) .",

The glycan models were subsequently built onto the corresponding asparagine side chains, and manually refined by Coot to avoid steric clashes. In cases when high mannose and complex type were both detected by MS at a given site, a complex type glycan was modeled; in case when no MS information was available but cryo-EM evidence was present to confirm the presence of N-glycosylation, i.e., N260, N585, N590, N774, N841 and N862, a basic type glycan (2 NAG + 3 Mannose) was generated for the modeling.

The resulting oligonucleotides were inserted into the pcDNA TM 3.1 plasmid. The constructs were transfected into FreeStyle 293-F Cells (Thermo Fisher) using 293fectin TM Transfection Reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were incubated at 37 \u00baC in 8% CO2 for five days. The supernatant was harvested after centrifugation of 1000 rpm for 20 min. The recombinant proteins were purified using the same procedure as used for full-length FIPV-UU4 S. The final protein concentrations were adjusted to 0.5 mg/mL. The glycan binding of FIPV-UU4 S variants were assessed by Glycan Array 100 (RayBiotech; https://www.raybiotech.com/glycan-array-100/) and GenePix 4000B Biochip Reader (Molecular Devices) (31, 32) . The amount of binding is reported by the observed fluorescence intensity, which is derived from triplicates with a standard deviation (SD) shown as a vertical line. The dotted line corresponds to the baseline of the array signals, which was derived from the background signals derived from blank measurements.
