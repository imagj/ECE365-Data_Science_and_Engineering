While public health and healthcare officials rushed to identify and contain the spread of the virus, information was spreading uninhibited over traditional and social media platforms at a strikingly rapid pace. Both the impact of the disease and the lack of information associated with it allowed medical misinformation to rapidly surface and propagate on various social media platforms. Previous reports have highlighted a similar trend during recent public health emergencies, mainly the Ebola and Zika outbreaks [3, 4] . Such a phenomenon is alarming on both individual and public health levels to an extent that governing bodies are realizing its gravity and attempting to limit its effects [5] [6] [7] .",

Firstly, our study was limited to the English language, which might have an impact on the generalizability of the findings to tweets spread by other languages. Second, the use of specific hashtags and keywords might have resulted in missing other tweets that do not necessarily utilize them. However, we selected the most common terms and hashtags that were trending on Twitter during the period of study. Third, our search timeframe was limited and hence might not capture the changing topics that evolve with the epidemic. This invites further research on the longitudinal evolution of misinformation as an epidemic or other global issue evolves and expands internationally. Nevertheless, we believe that our study offers robust and timely data on a serious challenge during the current COVID-19 epidemic and fills an important information gap.",
