A combinative approach of real-time RT-PCR, CRISPR-based assay and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) were used to diagnose this unexplained pneumonia patient. Real-time RT-PCR and CRISPR-based assay both reported positive. This sample belonged to Betacoronavirus and shared a more than 99% nucleotide (nt) identity with the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We further compared pros and cons of common molecular diagnostics in UP. In this study, we illustrated the importance of combining molecular diagnostics to rule out common pathogens and performed mNGS to obtain unbiased potential pathogen result for the diagnosis of UP.",

In late December 2019, Chinese social media first released news concerning the possible severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infected cases in Wuhan. On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Hubei province, China announced a cluster of unexplained pneumonia (UP) and later a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as named by the WHO was declared to be the causative agent [1, 2] . During the following month, multiple SARS-CoV-2 cases were gradually reported all over China and around 9000 definite cases were declared by 31 January 2020 [3] . As of today, case reports are still escalating on a daily basis. The reasons behind this outbreak are numerous, the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, limited pathogen detection method for unexplained pneumonia, the high population density of the Hubei Province and across China, etc. Various diagnostic methods were used during the initial search of this novel virus, yet their pros and cons have not been discussed thoroughly.",

Current bioinformatic pipeline for metagenomics works by mapping the sequenced reads to an existing database of previously known microbes. This approach may result in partial alignment of a novel pathogen genome to that of some previously identified microbes and lead to incorrect taxonomic classification [12] . In fact, during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, one of the first news releases came from a report of commercial sequencing company stating their identification of SARS virus, causing wide panic among society. And only later after careful analysis on more sequencing data, the causative agent was found to be a novel species. The advantage of metagenomic sequencing lies in its unbiased nature which enables it to play a crucial role in the future diagnosis of the unexplained pneumonia, especially when encountering untypical causative pathogen. The alert should be raised that results from metagenomic sequencing should always be interpreted with the consultant of medical professionals, especially when dealing with a potentially novel pathogen or clustered cases.",

Moreover, by harnessing an unbiased metagenomic assay, the clinicians were also granted with information on potential concomitant infections to guide more appropriate treatment. Looking forward, as the CRISPR-based techniques further mature, we envisage its broader clinical uses for targeted, rapid pathogen detection especially in under-resourced settings where complicated PCR instruments may not be available.
