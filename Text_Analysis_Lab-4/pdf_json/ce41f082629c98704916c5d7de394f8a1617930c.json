It charts the history and development of the three principal types of booksellers in the general interest book market-the state-owned Xinhua bookstores, private booksellers, and online retailers. In doing this, the article hopes to consider some of the industry's latest developments and its future by reflecting on them in a historical light.",

            "text": "Over the last three to four decades, the field of book retailing in China has changed in an unrecognizable manner. It has transformed from a field monopolized by the state-owned Xinhua bookstores between the 1950s and 1970s into one in which private booksellers accounted for over half of the general interest book market during the 1990s, and one in which online retailers, owned by large Chinese or foreign corporations, sell more books to consumers than do the high street retailers combined. How did all this happen? Why is it that when faced with competition from online retailers, Xinhua could largely maintain its trade position, but privately run bricksand-mortar bookstores wilted and declined precipitously? Is the fate of the private bricks-and-mortar bookseller doomed? And how exactly did online retailers become (Chinese yuan) sales each year. Xinhua bookstores are organized on a provincial basis-that is, all Xinhua bookstores in a province are owned by the provincial Xinhua bookstore company. Most provincial Xinhua bookstore companies operate like a chain, especially in terms of centralized stocking. (Centralized stocking is usually organized by sheng dian, or 'provincial head store', which is responsible for ordering and distributing books to all lower-level Xinhua bookstores in its province except for those in the province's capital city, which are coordinated and supplied by shi dian, or 'municipal head store', which operates independently of sheng dian). But member Xinhua bookstores are subsidiary companies rather than chain stores of the provincial Xinhua Bookstore company, and many Xinhua bookstores manage their own lower-level branches. A provincial Xinhua bookstore company is often a member of the large publishing group in its province. For instance, Zhejiang Xinhua Bookstore Corporation, which controls all Xinhua bookstores within Zhejiang Province, is a subsidiary company of Zhejiang Publishing United Group.",

For most of the three decades from the mid-1950s, Xinhua operated as a centralized national organization, led by the Xinhua General Store in Beijing. In 1987, the centralized Xinhua Bookstore system was dissolved. The Xinhua General Store was turned into a large distributor and retailer managed by the central government (and then merged into China Publishing Group in the early 2000s), and all local Xinhua bookstores were taken over by their provincial governments. The decentralization of Xinhua was accompanied by other structural and organizational reform of the bookseller, one of which was to turn the individual Xinhua bookstores from fully subsidized public 'cultural institutions' into self-financing business entities. By the early 2000s, most Xinhua bookstores had completed the reform and become for-profit enterprises. Yet, despite now being mutually independent companies, all Xinhua bookstores have retained the name 'Xinhua', which indicates their unchanged nature as state-owned enterprises.",

            "text": "Today, in terms of sales, Xinhua is the largest bookseller in China, but whether or not it is the largest book 'retailer' is difficult to determine, as over half of Xinhua's book sales are generated through the non-retail market. In 2015, Xinhua bookstores across China sold a total of \u00a574.1 billion worth of books, of which 56 per cent (41.8 billion) were textbooks and school supplementary materials-jiaofu jiaocai, or T&S books-which are sold primarily through the educational book distribution channel rather than the retail market. This means that in 2015 Xinhua's share in the retail book market in China was around \u00a532.3 billion (See Fig. 2 ). Since there are no official data on the sales produced by private booksellers, it is difficult to know what kind of market position this 32.3 billion sales gave to Xinhua. But, a widely agreed estimate is that in today's retail book market in China, Xinhua tends to account for about 40 per cent, which is surpassed by online retailers by about 5-10 per cent (i.e. online sales account for 45-50 per cent), with private booksellers combined accounting for the remaining 10-15 per cent.",

T&S books, especially school textbooks, are considered the most profitable type of book in China-both for publishers and for distributors/ retailers-and Xinhua has been the sole distributor for school textbooks for decades. Nowadays, some provinces allow private companies to bid for the right to distribute school textbooks, but Xinhua's financial clout as state-owned companies and longterm monopoly in the field mean that private firms can hardly win such bids. Xinhua, therefore, will continue, at least in the short term, to enjoy and benefit from its privilege in the distribution of textbooks.",

Furthermore, Xinhua bookstores in prefectural-level towns and rural areas have been exempt from VAT for decades, whereas the same policy was not made available to private booksellers until 2013.

Their emergence and development was driven and hastened by the public's high demand for books and booksellers, in the wake of the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. During the Cultural Revolution (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) , the only books available to most ordinary Chinese people were works by Chairman Mao Zedong, as publishers were not allowed to publish many other books and many Xinhua bookstores were closed [7] . As a result, when the Cultural Revolution ended after the demise of Mao in 1976, the public's demand for books exploded. In this context, private booksellers appeared and flourished across China, first in the form of small book vendors, and then more bricks-and-mortar shops opened. It is estimated that by 1987 there were over 10,000 private booksellers in China, about 1.18 times more than Xinhua's outlets ( [8] : 53).",

These quality booksellers were a contrast to the mercenary private booksellers in the preceding decades. Since the early 1990s, many of what would have come to be known as 'academic booksellers' (xueshu shudian) began to appear in China. Examples included All Sages Bookstore in Beijing, opened in 1993 by two Peking University (PKU) graduates, and Sisyphe Bookstore, also founded in 1993 by a PKU graduate, in a small south-western city called Zunyi. It is believed that more than 1500 such 'academic booksellers' had opened across China during the 1990s [3] . These booksellers were called 'academic booksellers' because they specialized in xueshu shu, or 'academic book', which in China specifically refers to books in the fields of the social sciences and humanities, especially philosophy, history, political science, sociology, law, and so on. 3 The scholarly content made 'academic books' highly regarded by the public; and for their passion for and dedication to 'academic books', 'academic booksellers' were esteemed a respectable group of booksellers [12] . Naturally, the rise of 'academic booksellers' helped to change the public's perception of private booksellers and hence reshaped the retail book market and book culture in China.",

In that year, due to the outbreak of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus, in order to minimize the risk of infection by going to crowded places like supermarkets, many Chinese chose to shop online. This accidentally boosted the use of the Internet in Chinese households and led to the rapid growth of online retailers, including online booksellers like Dangdang and Joyo [17, 18] .

Today, it accounts for around 40 per cent of the online bookselling market in China, approximately the sum of sales by competitors Amazon.cn and JD.com. As the first and largest online book retailer in China, Dangdang resembles Amazon.com in many respects, especially in terms of its struggle to achieve profitability in its early years. Like Amazon, who had run at a loss for 8 years since launching in 1995 [20] , Dangdang had operated on a loss-making basis for nearly a decade. The bookseller did not report its first net annual profit of \u00a510 million until 2009. In 2010, Dangdang listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Yet, right after its listing, the bookseller returned to loss-making: it lost \u00a5228 million, \u00a5444 million, and \u00a5143 million in 2011, 2012, and 2013. The company did not achieve profitability again until 2014, in which year it earned \u00a588 million. By this time, however, it is difficult to know how much of Dangdang's profit was generated from bookselling, as the bookseller had diversified into general retailing since 2004. Just like Amazon.com, Dangdang is now an online retailer selling not only books but also merchandise ranging from household appliances to clothes.",

Opening in 2000, Joyo was the second online bookseller in China. Unlike Dangdang, Joyo broke even almost immediately after opening and began to generate a profit in 2003. In 2004, Amazon. com acquired Joyo.com for $75 million and turned it into its official Chinese website. In 2007, the company launched its new website Amazon.cn to replace Joyo.com and began to use the name 'Joyo Amazon', which it replaced with 'Amazon China' in 2011. However, neither Joyo Amazon nor Amazon China was able to replicate in China the success of other members of the Amazon family in other book markets in the world. In 2014, Amazon.cn had market share which was considerably smaller than that of long-term rival Dangdang, and precariously close to that of newcomer Fig. 4) . Today, statistics show that Amazon.cn has already been overtaken by JD.com. Like Amazon.com and Dangdang, Amazon.cn is also a general retailer. Yet, its market share in general online retailing is even smaller than its share in bookselling. In 2015, it accounted for only 0.9 per cent of China's online retail market, negligible compared with Alibaba-run Tmall's 58 per cent and JD.com's 22.9 per cent [21] . Given the two companies' predominance in the general online retail market, it is not surprising to find that they are playing an important-and increasingly so-role in the Chinese online bookselling field.",

However, when JD.com began to sell books in 2010, which was widely believed to be the company's strategy to use books as loss leaders to attract customers to visit its website and buy other merchandise, it adopted a much more aggressive approach to discounting. In order to compete directly with Dangdang, JD.com not only matched the trade leader's prices, but it also introduced some new sales methods, such as \u00a550/100 off when spending \u00a5100/200. These methods could mean an additional 50 per cent off on top of the existing discounts and had never been used before by Dangdang or Amazon.cn, as they almost meant outright loss-making by rendering selling prices lower than cost prices.",

It also for the first time offered the \u00a5100 off when spending \u00a5200 deal, and announced that it had raised \u00a540 million to fund this 'sale'. A few hours later, JD.com said its budget for the promotion was \u00a580 million. The next day, Amazon.cn joined the battle by also reducing its prices by 20 per cent. The aggressive discounting by the three websites led to a storm of protests by publishers and physical booksellers. One week later, the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP, the former SAPPRFT) stepped in and ordered the three companies to stop their sales. However, what the GAPP could not stop was the three leading online retailers' increasing use of the price-cutting practice in competition. Since 2010, Dangdang, Amazon.cn, and JD.com have been involved in a number of price wars, which led to the normalization of the high discount of 28-35 per cent and the regular special sales (sales that all three online 1 3 retailers give a number of times throughout the year) in which average discounts can be at least 50 per cent.",

For publishers, they argue that by allowing publishers to open their own online bookstores, Tmall Books could help arrest the price-cutting practice adopted by the big online retailers. The theory is that since publishers could now sell books to customers on their own via the Internet, they can rely less on Dangdang and the like and hence have more power to negotiate with them when demanded for unfair terms. This theory, however, has not been entirely testified on the part of publishers, as all publishers that I interviewed said that sales through Dangdang, JD, and Amazon China were still highly important to them. Despite this, however, they did all state that their organizations either had already or were to set up bookstores on Tmall, as they believed that it was important to do so for it could give them 'more initiative' when it comes to selling books online.",

The plans for bookstores by the latter also involved considerable spending (Dangdang plans to open 1000 bookstores in the next 3 years). It is not the first time that we have heard similar ambitious plans. Phoenix-Power, which began as a book wholesaler, has opened a chain of more than 20 bookstores called Belencre (\u5b57\u91cc\u884c\u95f4) in the past 5 years, but this is still a far cry from the 100 in their initial announcement. From these statistics, a 'booming' of bricks-and-mortar booksellers seems to be occurring in China. Such (seemingly) revival of the physical bookstore should not be unfamiliar to observers of the book industry in the West. What I refer to, however, is not-at least not only-the similar business plans at the online bookselling giants-Amazon.com in the US and Dangdang.com in China-to further expand their territory in book retailing by launching more new physical shops. Rather, what I mean here is the increase in the number of high street bookshops opened up by individuals or firms that are not a chain, a phenomenon which has been observed over the past few years on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US, the American Booksellers Association has been celebrating growth in its membership since 2009 [24, 25] . In the UK, according to the Booksellers Association, in 2017 the number of independent bookshops in the UK and Ireland increased, rather than decreased, for the first time in twenty-two years since 1995. It seems that, like their Western counterparts, China's physical booksellers, after years of declining since the arrival of online retailers in China in the early 2000s, are poised for fighting back. It seems.",

This, without a doubt, adds a less bright note to the long-expected 'revival' of the bricks-and-mortar bookseller. The thing is, rather than making a profit-either from selling books or from the sidelines of various types that almost all bookstores run nowadays, which range from coffee shops and non-book merchandising to premium membership schemes-many of China's bricks-and-mortar booksellers depend for their survival on subsidies from owners, investors' money, and/or favourable business terms such as free rents.

Elsewhere, many new shopping centers, for the purpose of attracting business tenants, have also given fiveyear rent-free preferential treatment to bookstores. BIZ Peking [23] Therefore, what is distinctive about the current wave of bookshop booming in China is that it is driven primarily by some exogenous incentives, in particular government's tax reduction policy, the investment market's interest, and large shopping malls' business strategy. Nevertheless, while these incentives are clearly quite effective, whether or not they are going to be long-term, nobody knows. This hence brings to the fore the question to what extent the model behind the bookshop 'boom' is sustainable, which itself raises the question about the nature of this 'boom'-is it going to lead to a real revival of the bricks-and-mortar bookstore, or is it just a passing fad?",

Therefore, for any careful observers of the Chinese book retailing market, a shadow of doubt is always lurking about and prevents them from making any definitive predictions about the future of the trade. However, if there is anything that we can learn from the history of the industry, it is likely to be the understanding that, notwithstanding one of the oldest trades there is-having existed for over 2000 years in China [7] -the book trade is more resilient to new changes than it may first appear to be. That is, it is very doubtful that the (physical) bookstore will disappear from our society altogether. In the meantime, book retailing, a special kind of business activity that entails as much exchange of human knowledge, experiences, ideas, and even emotions as the transaction of material goods and finances, is too deeply grounded in interpersonal communication and interaction to be wholly fulfilled by computers and algorithms. Dangdang's ambition to open one thousand physical shops, for example, is revealing-perhaps more revealing than the recent spate of bookshops on the Chinese high street driven by the various rather contingent factors-about the vitality of bricks-and-mortar book retailing. Therefore, while the future of the book retailing industry in China may be unpredictable, it is not necessarily uncertain. Rather, what may be anticipated, based on what is learnt from the past, could be that after years of adjusting and reorientation, the moment for the book retailing industry to redress its balance between bricks-and-mortar bookselling and online retailing, and for the power relation between physical booksellers and online retailers to rebalance, has finally arrived in China.",
