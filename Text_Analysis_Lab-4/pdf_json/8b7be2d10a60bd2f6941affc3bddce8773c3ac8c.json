            "text": "Previous studies (5, 6) have shown that the phylogenetically related SARS-CoV is proteolytically activated by TMPRSS2 in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we attempted to isolate SARS-CoV-2 using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, which express TMPRSS2 constitutively. The messenger RNA expression level of TMPRSS2 in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells is \u223c10-fold higher than in normal human lung tissue and other human cell lines (Fig. 1A) . SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV (2), and ACE2 expression is very high in VeroE6 cells (7) . Seven clinical specimens (throat swabs or sputum) obtained from seven SARS-CoV-2 infection cases were inoculated into VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, which were monitored daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). These clinical specimens were deidentified prior to use, and this study was approved by the ethics committee of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan (approval no. 1091). Informed consent was obtained from all participants, from which the subjects were obtained, or their legally acceptable representatives for sample donation. In five cases among the seven, clear CPE with detachment/floating (black arrows, Table 1) . The virus titers in culture supernatants of the five cases at 3 d p.i. were 4.6 \u00d7 10 6 to 6.8 \u00d7 10 7 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) per mL (Table 1) . Typical coronavirus particles were detected by electron microscopy (Fig.  1C ). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of case Wk-521 detected the nearly full-length genome sequence from SARS-CoV-2 with >99.9% homology (1, 2) (GISAID database ID EPI_ISL_408667). Unexpectedly, the NGS data showed contaminated mycoplasma sequences (Mycoplasma hyorhinis and Mycoplasma arginini) from VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. CPE in VeroE6 cells persistently infected with SARS-CoV was enhanced by infection with Mycoplasma fermentans (8), but whether a similar situation exists for SARS-CoV-2-related CPE in this cell line is unclear.",

However, the viral RNA copies in the VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cell culture supernatants were >100 times greater than those from VeroE6 cells (Fig. 1 D and E) . Data for SARS-CoV show that TMPRSS2 enhances its entry efficiency (5, 11) . VeroE6 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were infected with 10-fold serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 samples, and the infected cells were visualized by indirect immunofluorescent assays (Fig. 1E) . The results showed that VeroE6/TMPRSS2 displayed \u223c10-fold greater number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells than the parental VeroE6 cells.
