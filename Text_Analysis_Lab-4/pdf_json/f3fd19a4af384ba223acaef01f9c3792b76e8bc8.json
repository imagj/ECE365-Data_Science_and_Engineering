For telehealth to be effective as part of an emergency response it first needs to become a routinely used part of our health system. Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed. In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur. Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce. Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care. Implementing telehealth proactively rather than reactively is more likely to generate greater benefits in the longterm, and help with the everyday (and emergency) challenges in healthcare.",

The North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) (an intergovernmental military alliance between 29 members including North American and European countries), developed a Multinational Telemedicine System in 2000 that has been deployed with their military forces during various crises. 5 Through solutions such as person-deployable portable telemedicine kits and satellite linkage, areas in need have received health support from medical experts located in other countries. 6 During hurricanes Harvey and Irma, 7 private telemedicine companies provided care to victims relocated from their homes and primary care providers. Following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, China began exploring telehealth and integrated electronic medical systems for use in similar situations in the future. 8 During severe prolonged droughts in Australia, the health department introduced new funding through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) to allow clinicians to provide additional mental health services via videoconferencing. 9 In 2019, similar mental health services were also offered to people affected by the bushfires. 9 Whilst the potential benefits of telehealth are clear, 10-12 the uptake of telehealth in emergency situations has been limited. As an example, the funding provided by the Australian government to support the delivery of online (videoconference) mental health services to people affected in the bushfire crisis seems to have had little impact. 13 Despite the availability of MBS funding, claims data shows only four telehealth visits were provided in the first three months.",

            "text": "Dependency on individual clinicians to lead telehealth is not a sustainable approach to the expansion of telehealth. Telehealth adoption requires a whole-system strategy. Embedding telehealth into routine service delivery, by all healthcare providers, is the most effective way of ensuring telehealth can be readily used during emergencies. This requires operational telehealth networks, telehealth policies and procedures, and technology infrastructure that can be scaled-up during times of disaster. Telehealth is a disruptive process, so there is a need for effective changemanagement strategies to support clinicians with limited telehealth experience. Furthermore, simulated testing of telehealth applications for emergency situations is also a useful way of ensuring that workflow processes are clear and effective. 29 Multiple resources are available to support disaster preparedness and response strategies. For example, the American Telemedicine Association Emergency and Response special interest group has developed a framework and infrastructure checklist that could be used at local, regional and national levels during disaster events. 30 The NATO Multinational Telemedicine System (described above) resulted in the development of a system, supported by guidelines and technology solutions, which is able to interconnect various national telemedicine capabilities for use during disasters. 5 In the absence of any formal telehealth strategy, it is important to make telehealth guidelines available to assist with co-ordination and delivery of telehealth services during an emergency event. This information needs to suit all stakeholders, including patients, clinicians, health service providers and funders. 31 International health agencies such as the World Health Organization, national centres for disease control, and health departments have been disseminating real-time information about COVID-19 via their websites and social media outlets 32, 33 and have a very important role to play in advocating for the use of telehealth via these channels. These organisations can increase awareness of telehealth, provide specific recommendations on effective telehealth use, and validate the importance of telehealth's role in the healthcare sector.",
