Children are often in close physical proximity at school, have less-than-perfect hygiene behaviours and have low prior immunity to many infections [1] . For this reason, school closures are often proposed as one way of delaying the spread of infection [2] . There is evidence to suggest that social contacts should reduce when schools are closed. For example, it has been reported that students have contact with fewer people during weekends [3] and that the number of contacts children have with others approximately halves during the holidays [4, 5] . Several studies have also examined illness transmission rates during planned school closures, reporting a reduction in illness during school holidays [6] [7] [8] and teacher strikes [9] .",

One of the key unknowns is what happens to children after a school is closed. The optimum answer from an epidemiological perspective is that children remain in their homes for the duration of the closure, never coming into contact with another person [12, 13] . However, this is impractical and from front-line experience of outbreak management, there are many accounts of children continuing to congregate after being sent home from school and sometimes engaging in behaviour likely to increase the risks of infection spreading [14, 15] . Any full assessment of the impact of school closures should take this into account.",

Rapid reviews follow the general principles of a systematic review but may be simplified, for example, by not including grey literature or conducting a full quality appraisal, in order to produce information in a shorter period of time with minimal impact on quality. They are essential in circumstances such as the developing situation with COVID-19 as policymakers urgently need synthesised evidence in order to make informed decisions regarding guidelines for the public. As there are no specific guidelines and no standardised methodology for rapid reviews, the PRISMA checklist has not been completed. However, the only Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [16] checklist items that this study lacks relate to the analysis of risk of bias in individual studies; because of time constraints, a quality assessment of each paper was not conducted.",

However, social contact was still common: all 19 studies showed that at least some children took part in activities outside of the home during school closures, even despite health recommendations to remain indoors and isolated from others. In fact, eight studies [17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28, 32] showed that the majority of children (i.e. more than 50%) left the home or took part in activities involving non-household members, including the UK study of school closures during the H1N1 outbreak which found that 98% of children left their homes during that time [17] .",

Parents reported various difficulties associated with school closures, primarily lost income, the effort of arranging alternate childcare and uncertainty about the duration of the closure [33, 34] . Some studies also illustrated a lack of consistency by schools regarding the importance of not participating in social activities.

However, the effects of a closure will be attenuated if children continue to mix. Of the 19 papers that we identified, all reported that some degree of mixing continued to occur outside of the home. We should not be surprised at this. Even for adults, self-isolation can be difficult [35] and stressful [36] , and children often have wider social circles and feel more social pressure to interact. The precise extent to which contact patterns change during a closure is harder to determine. Only a limited number of studies have attempted to quantify this, reporting reductions in the number of contacts from 70.3 on typical school days to 24.8 [17] and 14.2 to 6.5 [18] during closures. The difference in rates reported are likely because of social and cultural differences as well as differences in definitions of a 'contact' between the papers: there appear to be various definitions of 'social contacts' in addition to what vicinity and duration are necessary for an encounter to be considered a 'contact'.",

Assuming infection given a contact is a function of duration and type of contact, this can form the basis of more evidence-based modelling and risk assessment.",

In this regard, it was concerning that two studies appeared to highlight a lack of clarity in terms of advice about whether children could take part in social activities and knowing what children were and were not advised to do [30, 32] .

For example, one study involving a hypothetical scenario of schools closing for 3 months because of an influenza pandemic found that 85% of parents responsible for children aged between 5 and 17 years of age believed they would be able to keep their children from taking public transport, going to public events and gathering outside the home during this lengthy school closure period [39] . Meanwhile, another found that 96.7% of parents claimed they would keep their children away from others for a month if schools and child-care facilities were closed [40] .

With relatively few studies in this field, it is difficult to disentangle these effects. The majority of studies examined school closures because of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and behaviours during this period may not necessarily reflect behaviours during closures for other reasons or even other infectious diseases. Additionally, several studies looked at school closures because of influenza-like illnesses, which may be considered to be mild and not too dangerous in children [41] . Behaviour during closures for this reason may be different to behaviour during closures for diseases perceived as more severe. It must also be noted that the majority of included studies were from the US, perhaps because of our decision to limit the review to English or Italian papers, and thus may not be generalisable to other cultures or countries. Future reviews should consider including papers published in other languages. While we extracted the duration of school closure from studies included in the review (Table) , we did not formally analyse whether the length of school closure was associated with children's activities and contacts made outside the home. The closures we identified lasted for less than 2 weeks, limiting our ability to draw conclusions on this. However, we note that practical issues, including difficulties with childcare and economic impact, were identified by several studies. It seems plausible that longer closures would increase these difficulties. Also, while ideally this review would have calculated a mean reduction in contacts based on all studies or an overall percentage of children who left the home across all studies, this kind of calculation was not possible because of the differences in the way studies measured contacts, the time over which they were measured and the different ways of reporting this information.",

Indeed, planned school holidays may be a fair proxy for short-term closures for some parents but we cannot be sure that this can be extrapolated to longer-term closures, e.g. schools potentially closed for months. Human behaviour is complex and understanding how people respond to an evolving and urgent policy is essential. Basing policy on historical patterns may give false confidence in results and not capture uncertainty adequately. Recent reviews of the incorporation of human behaviour into infectious disease models have advocated the use of appropriate, detailed, real-world behavioural data within infectious disease modelling [44, 45] . We hope that our identification of real-world data concerning social contact and mixing behaviour during unexpected school closures will help improve existing models and promote rigorous quantitative research in this area.",

Contact with children who were not immediate family members was less likely during days spent at home. No child visited a household in which another child was ill, compared with reported child visitors in 15.9% of 226 homes without a case. Households with influenza: adult from outside the home (44.4% for households that complied with advice to remain in home vs 2.4% for non-compliant households). Households without influenza: adult from outside the home (28.3% for households that complied vs 4.0% for non-compliant households). 24.8% in primary school, 25.1% in junior high school and 24.9% in high school; age range 4-18 years; 'school closure or class suspension at least once' because of H1N1.20.5% left the home for non-essential reasons.There was a reduction in the number of contacts made by students (14.2 contacts/ day when open vs 6.5 when closed). Students reduced their number of contacts with individuals under 18 years of age (75% reduction) and 19-59-year-olds (20% reduction), while increasing contacts with individuals aged 60 years and over (52% increase), although the absolute value remained low (less than one contact/day). 232 households; school for children aged 5-12 years; school closed for 7 days because of H1N1.13% went to public places or gatherings at least once, 12% visited relatives, 5% went to parents' workplace.",
