At 50-60% confluency, cells were transfected with siRNA using TransIT-siQUEST transfection reagent (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated at 37 in a CO2 incubator. After incubating for 24 h, the siRNA-treated cells were split and plated onto 12-well plates for virus collection or 4-well chamber slides for IFA. After incubation at 37 in a CO2 incubator for 24 h, cells were transfected with MHV genomic RNA (1.5 \uf06dg/well) using TransIT mRNA reagent (Mirus) or infected with MHV. The supernatant medium was collected from MHV genomic RNA transfected /MHV infected cells or the cells in chamber slides were fixed at 24 h post-transfection for virus titration and IFA, respectively. The knockdown efficiency of siRNAs was confirmed by Western blot.",
