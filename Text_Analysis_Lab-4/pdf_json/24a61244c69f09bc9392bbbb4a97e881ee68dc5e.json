            "text": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a dsDNA virus responsible for a severe, highly contagious, and lethal disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs. ASFV has brought enormous economic loss to a number of countries, and effective vaccine and therapy are still lacking. Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, and field-deployable detection of ASFV is important for disease surveillance and control. Herein, we developed a Cas12a-mediated portable paper assay to rapidly and precisely detect ASFV. We identified a robust set of crRNAs that recognized the highly conserved region of essential ASFV genes. The Cas12a-mediated detection assay showed low tolerance for mismatch mutations, and no cross-reactivity against other common swine pathogens. We further developed a paper-based assay to allow instrument-free detection of ASFV. Specifically, we applied gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugate to engineer homemade strips and combined it with Cas12a-mediated ASFV detection. This portable paper, instrument-free diagnostics, faithfully detected ASFV in swine samples, showing comparable sensitivity to the traditionally instrumentdependent qPCR method. Taking together, we developed a highly sensitive, instant, and economic Cas12a-mediated paper diagnostics of ASFV, with a great application potential for monitoring ASFV in the field.",

ASF has spread into a number of countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia during the past decade, with the possibility of further expansion 1, 3 . The causative agent, ASF virus (ASFV), is a large double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the family Asfarviridae 2,4,5 . Due to the lack of vaccine and effective treatments against ASFV, disease control mainly relies on culling pigs 1, 4 . More than 30 million domestic pigs were culled in the past 2 years, and the number continues to increase 6 . Thus, rapid diagnosis of the ASFV-affected animal is crucial to prevent its broad expansion, and to reduce economic losses 7, 8 .",

Although virus isolation is the gold standard to diagnose ASFV, this timeconsuming and complicated procedure is not applicable for real-time monitoring diseases 11 . Detection of ASFV antigen enables testing samples on a large scale, but it is not sensitive enough in detecting early-stage infection 8 . Both quantitative PCR (qPCR) and conventional PCR are fast and sensitive methods for detecting ASFV 9,11-13 . However, PCR methods require skilled operation and thermocyclers, making them less suitable for the field applications 14 . Isothermal amplification allows for easier operation and rapid amplification of DNA at a constant temperature independent of lab instruments 8,15-18 . However, nonspecific DNA amplification and high falsepositive rates remain a big concern 15 . Therefore, a specific, sensitive, rapid, and equipment-free assay is urgently demanded for monitoring ASFV in the field.",

            "text": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated (Cas) systems recognize and cleave specific nucleic acid sequences (namely cis-cleavage) 19, 20 . Some Cas proteins, including Cas12a, Cas12b, Cas13a, and Cas14, exhibit noncanonical trans-cleavage activity (alternative name \"collateral effect\") [21] [22] [23] [24] . Upon activation via recognizing a specific target sequence, these proteins exhibited the collateral effect by cleaving nontarget sequences [21] [22] [23] [24] . Cas13a, an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease, gets activated via binding with sequence-specific RNA substrates. Activated Cas13a developed its nonspecific ribonuclease activity to degrade nearby single-stranded RNAs 23 . By combining the trans-cleavage activity of Cas13a with isothermal amplification and in vitro transcription of DNA to RNA, Cas13a-based platform enables detection of nucleic acid at attomolar sensitivity 25 . When engineered with lateral flow for visual readout, it can generate a portable, rapid, and sensitive detection platform 26, 27 . However, the in vitro transcription process is time-consuming, and the RNA probe used in the assay is unstable and expensive, limiting its broad applications. Cas12a, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, recognizes dsDNA, and upon activation, exhibits its nonspecific single stranded DNA (ssDNA) endonuclease activities 21, 28 . Combining the collateral effect of Cas12a with isothermal amplification and a fluorescence readout has created a rapid and specific detection platform 21 . Cas12abased detection assay is more straightforward than Cas13a, and its DNA probe is more stable and cost-effective. However, the fluorescence readout of Cas12a-based assay requires lab instruments. According to a recent report, the detection signal can be observed by naked eye under blue light 29 . This procedure is not suitable for detection in the field, as it requires a centrifuge, and its signal can be interfered in biological samples.",

It is critical to establish a single crRNA strategy that monitors most ASFV subtypes via the CRISPR-based detection 9,11-13 . To achieve this goal, we designed six crRNAs by either targeting the conserved regions of polyprotein pp220 (briefly as pp220) or DNA polymerase gene (DNA Pol), both of which are essential to ASFV life cycle 2,5 (Supplementary Table S1 ). The ability to specifically cleave pp220 or DNA Pol double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences by Cas12a-crRNA complex was demonstrated by in vitro cleavage activity assay (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). To confirm the trans-effect of Cas12a after target recognition, a ssDNA, FAM-Quencher reporter, was designed and synthesized (FAM-TTATT-Quencher, as ssDNA-FQ reporter). Upon ssDNA cleavage by Cas12a, the FAM signal is released and measured. The assay showed little background when the ssDNA-FQ reporter is intact (Supplementary Fig. S2a , b). When DNA Pol or pp220 dsDNA sequences were presented, the crRNA1-targeted DNA Pol and crRNA5-targeted pp220 outperformed other crRNAs in terms of fluorescence intensity and activity kinetics (Fig. 1a, b) . Therefore, crRNA1 targeting DNA Pol and crRNA5 targeting pp220 were selected for further experiments.",

Only mutations in the PAM-distal 19-20 nt for crRNA1 and crRNA5, and in the PAM-distal 17-18 group for crRNA5, showed substantial fluorescence signal (Fig. 2a,  b) , indicating the high specificity of Cas12a-based detection for ASFV sequences. To further investigate whether Cas12a-based fluorescence detection could tolerate point mutation, a series of 1-nt mutations were introduced into the target DNA. Consistent with the 2-nt mutation data, we observed a much reduced fluorescence signal in the point mutation of 17 nucleotides next to PAM, and the point mutation of the PAM-distal 18-20 still showed substantial fluorescence signal ( Supplementary Fig. S3a , b). However, we observed more than background fluorescence signals in several point-mutated sequences, suggesting that detection systems based on Cas12a may partially tolerate point mutation at certain positions. These data are consistent with a previous study, indicating that Cas12b-based nucleic acid detection platform partially tolerated point mutation 30 . We also detected the fluorescence signal of several 1-nt deletion or insertion sequences, and these sequences showed little fluorescence signal ( Supplementary Fig. S3c ).",

Both DNA pol crRNA1 and pp220 crRNA5 showed a high and specific fluorescence signal against ASFV, whereas other pathogen viruses triggered few signals (Fig. 3a , b). Since it is possible that veterinary samples are contaminated by human viruses, we put the guide sequences of crRNA1 and crRNA5 in nucleotide BLAST, and analyzed the top comparison results. All viruses other than ASFV from the analysis showed less than 60% sequence similarity, suggesting low target sequence similarity of swine and human viruses (Supplementary Table S2 ).

Au nanoparticles conjugated with an anti-FITC antibody were on the binding pad. The streptavidin and IgG were fixed on the NC membrane, as a control line to specifically bind biotin, and test line to specifically bind an anti-FITC antibody, respectively. The FAM-Biotin ssDNA reporter specifically bound to Au nanoparticles to form a complex because FAM can be recognized by the anti-FITC antibody on the Au nanoparticles. When ssDNA was not degraded by Cas12a, this complex bound to streptavidin at the control line. On the contrary, when ssDNA was degraded to cause Biotin release from the complex, the complex could pass through the control line, Fig. 4 Cas12a-based fluorescence detection of veterinary samples. Genomic DNA was extracted from swine blood or anal swab. Blood samples 1-5 or 6-8 were determined by qPCR as positive or negative of ASFV, respectively. Anal swab samples 1 or 2-3 were determined by qPCR as positive or negative of ASFV, respectively. PCR amplification of DNA Pol and pp220 genes was performed. The genomic DNA from blood (a, c) or anal swab (b, d) was used. Fluorescence were measured for 120 min after incubation with Cas12a, ssDNA reporter, and crRNA1 (a, b) or crRNA5 (c, d). and bound to the IgG antibody on the test line. When we applied the concentration of reporters used in fluorescence assay for lateral flow detection, an obvious falsepositive band was shown in blank control (Fig. 5a) . We believed that a portion of nanoparticles did not bind to the FAM-Biotin ssDNA reporter; thus, they kept moving forward until they reached the test band to make the potential false-positive result. Various concentrations of FAM-Biotin ssDNA reporter were added. A higher concentration of FAM-Biotin ssDNA reporter gradually diminished the false-positive band (Fig. 5a) . Thus, we chose 1 \u03bcM as the concentration of reporter for the next set of experiments. When we used the concentration of LbCas12a/crRNA complex used in fluorescence assay for lateral flow detection, the test band appeared in positive samples ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). However, the band was fuzzy despite the extended reaction time. When we increased the concentration of LbCas12a/crRNA complex, the test band was striking in positive samples, but it was not shown in negative samples (Supplementary Fig.  S4 ). To examine the optimal reaction time and temperature of Cas12a-based lateral flow, we compared reaction times of 1, 2, 5, and 10 min, and reaction temperature of 4\u00b0C, room temperature and 37\u00b0C. We identified that 1-or 2-min reaction time was sufficient to observe a clear test band, and the reaction at room temperature showed a clearer band than at 4 and 37\u00b0C ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ).",

Due to the lack of effective vaccine and treatment, the development of a real-time ASFV detection method is critical to limit the disease expansion at an early stage 7, 8 . CRISPR-Cas systems are revolutionary tools allowing for precise genome engineering, transcription regulation, and many other applications [31] [32] [33] . The trans-activity of several class 2 Cas endonucleases allows sensitive and robust detection of nucleic acids [21] [22] [23] [24] . Among them, Cas12a recognizes specific dsDNA sequences, and then nonspecifically cleaves ssDNA, making it particularly suitable for detecting dsDNA viruses 21 . In combination with isothermal amplification, we found that Cas12a was able to detect ASFV with high sensitivity and precision. It is possible that other members of Cas12 family can also be used for ASFV detection. Cas12b-mediated DNA detection was recently developed, and it showed higher sensitivity than Cas12a on several examined sequences 34 . It may be useful to evaluate the potential of Cas12b for detecting ASFV in the future.",

However, a fluorescence reporter was used in the study, which restricted its application in the laboratories 21 . A recent study developed a blue lightbased readout 29 . Though this readout does not rely on laboratory equipment, it is less applicable in the field. We aimed to develop a strip-based, high-sensitivity assay to detect ASFV independent of lab instruments. We noticed that the conditions of Cas12a fluorescent assay cannot be directly applied for strip detection (Fig. 5) . After a thorough optimization of various parameters, we successfully generated a robust strip-based assay to fulfil the detection potential of Cas12a (Fig. 5) . The sensitivity of this assay is as low as 200 copies/sample, which is comparable as qPCR assay executed in laboratories ( Fig. 5 ; Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The low detection limit of the assay allows the diagnosis of ASF at the early stage of infection 38 . It is more sensitive and accurate than other field-applicable assays, which are usually based on isothermal amplification alone 11 . The strip can be kept in dry environment at 4\u00b0C for at least 3 months, as previously reported, making it suitable for commercial use [39] [40] [41] . Despite the robust results, the high cost of commercial strips limits their broad application for ASFV detection. To overcome this limitation, we successfully engineered a homemade strip using gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugate (named as Cas-gold). For the homemade version of strips, all parts were completed by hand. Because the detection line was made with multiple microspots, the strips had more smear bands than commercial ones. In the commercial production, this step can be completed by professional equipment to avoid this issue. Nevertheless, we showed that the homemade strip exhibited comparable results to the commercial strip (Fig. 6) . Homemade strip provides a robust, easy, and costeffective alternative. In summary, our study developed a field-deployable, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and accurate Cas12a-based strip method to faithfully detect ASFV (Fig. 7) .",
