Topic Modelling (punit2_lab4.ipynb)

In this lab, we will work with research papers published on different aspects of coronaviruses over the years. Our goal is to use topic modelling to know different areas each research paper talks about and answer some important questions regarding the viruses.

1. We will begin by first extracting full body text, abstract and title from each paper and cleaning them.

2. We will then use gensim library to create a LDA topic model on the extracted body texts.

3. We will then use topic modelling and try to find most relevant papers on aspects like vaccine and respiratory viruses.

4. Finally, we will look at coherence score as a measure of tuning the number of topics in LDA topic model
