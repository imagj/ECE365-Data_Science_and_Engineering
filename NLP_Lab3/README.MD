NLP_Lab3/punit2/NLPLab3/NLPLab3.ipynb problem set has the objective to train a language model, evaluate it and explore how it can be used for language generation. 
Towards that end you will see:

1. Train an n-gram language model.

2. Use that language model to generate representative sentences.

3. Study the effect of training data size, and language model complexity (n-gram size), on the modeling capacity of a language model.
