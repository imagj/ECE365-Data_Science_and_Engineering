# ECE365-Data_Science_and_Engineering

Big Data is all around us. Petabytes of data is collected by Google and Facebook. 24 hours of video is uploaded on Youtube every minute. Making sense of all this data in the relevant context is a critical question. This course takes a holistic view towards understanding how this data is collected, represented and stored, retrieved and computed/analyzed upon to finally arrive at appropriate outcomes for the underlying context. The course is based around three topics, drawn from diverse areas of engineering.
