The file punit2_lab3.ipynb  explores the concept of document clustering. In this lab, we will work with abstracts of research papers published on different aspects of coronaviruses over the years. Our goal is to segement the abstracts into different clusters based on the similarities in the topics that the abstracts talk about.

1. We will begin by first using TF-IDF vectorizer to create a feature space to represent the abstracts.
2. We will then use kmeans and hierarchical clustering to creates 3 different clusters and visualize them.
3. We will also look at parameters like intra-cluster and inter-cluster distances to access the efficacy of the clustering that we have done.
4. At last, we will look at the most important words for each of the clusters that we have created.
