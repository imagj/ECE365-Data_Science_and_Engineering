NLP_Lab2/punit2/NLPLab2/Lab2_NLP.ipynb contains a system for automatically classifying song lyrics comments by era. You will:

Do some basic text processing, tokenizing your input and converting it into a bag-of-words representation
Build a machine learning classifier based on the generative model, using Naive Bayes
Evaluate your classifiers and examine what they have learned
Build a logistic regression classifier (discriminative model) using PyTorch
