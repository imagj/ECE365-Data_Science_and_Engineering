NLP_Lab2/punit2/NLPLab2/Lab2_NLP.ipynb contains a system for automatically classifying song lyrics comments by era. You will:


1. Do some basic text processing, tokenizing your input and converting it into a bag-of-words representation

2. Build a machine learning classifier based on the generative model, using Naive Bayes

3. Evaluate your classifiers and examine what they have learned

4. Build a logistic regression classifier (discriminative model) using PyTorch
